### About Profitbase InVision

<br/>

### Intuitive web-based applications

<br/>

The InVision platform serves as a "Rapid Application Development" solution, empowering users to swiftly and effectively construct adaptable business solutions on a modern and robust technology stack. Users can leverage the platform's comprehensive standard components to develop a wide range of elements, including user interfaces and back-end functionality. This streamlined approach significantly reduces both cost and time when implementing projects.

Users utilize the Profitbase InVision Designer to construct applications, which are subsequently published as web applications within the organization. These web applications require minimal or no training to operate effectively.

Within a matter of minutes, users can download prebuilt business modules and install them, tailoring them to precisely meet the specific requirements of the customer.

Profitbase InVision seamlessly integrates with other business systems through a RESTful Web API or direct connection to the SQL data storage, facilitating effortless connectivity.

Users can expand Profitbase InVision's capabilities by constructing custom business modules using the Profitbase InVision Designer developer tool and Microsoft Visual Studio.

### Solution

A solution contains all of the data and configuration for your application, such as business logic, data stores, workbooks, worksheets, data flows, workflows, etc.

<br/>

**Clone Solution**

You can easily clone entire Solutions from the Designer start page. Cloning a Solution will also copy input data from the source Solution, permissions, and Data Flow schedules. Note that objects in cloned Solutions are not automatically added to the Data Pool after the cloning has been completed. They will, however, be added to the Data Pool if the Data Pool Compound View is rebuilt. If you don’t want this to happen, you need to edit your newly cloned Solution and remove the Data Pool configuration from the objects that you don’t want as members of the Data Pool.
<br/>

**When creating a new Solution**

Creating a new Solution requires specifying whether the Solution should provide contents to Work Process blueprints or not. This change was added because it was too easy to forget to set this property after a Package had been deployed.
<br/>

### Designer

The designer is the development tool for the InVision platform needed to create or modify solutions created on the InVision platform. The designer is a desktop application that is downloaded locally to your PC or server.
