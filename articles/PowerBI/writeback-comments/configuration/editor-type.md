# Editor type

Toggles Richtext mode on or off. 

If you enable Richtext mode, note that the comments written back to the data source will contain HTML tags. If you plan to display the comments by systems that does not render HTML well, keep Richtext turned off.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you enable Richtext mode, and then later decides to switch to plain text, HTML tags in the original comments will render as plain text in the editor.
