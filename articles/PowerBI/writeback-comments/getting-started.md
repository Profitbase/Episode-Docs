## Step-by-step guide
If videos are not your thing, here's a step-by-step guide to get started with the Writeback Comments visual.
<br/>

#### 1) Get the visual from AppSource or org.store
In PowerBI, go to the `Visualizations` panel and click `Get more visuals`.  
Search for `Writeback Comments by Profitbase` in the popup, and add it to the toolbox.

#### 2) Configure a data source using Direct Query
The Writeback Comments visual receives data from semantic models like any other Power BI visual. However, we stronly recommend the table for the Writeback Comments visual to use [Direct Query](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/service-dataset-modes-understand#directquery-mode) instead of import mode. This is because, when data is written back to a database (e.g., Azure SQL), , and import mode is used, users wonâ€™t see the changes until the semantic model is refreshed (which may minutes or hours, depending on your Power BI subscription). With DirectQuery, changes appear immediately.


#### 3) Add fields to the visual

**Key columns**  
In the data panel, add at least one field to the `Key columns well`. 
The fields in the `Key columns well` must be the unique key of the rows in the semantic model table. Editing in the visual is disabled when the selection applied by filters does not return a `single row`.  

**Comments column**
In the data panel, add one field to the `Comments well`.  
This must be the (text)field that contains the comments in the table.  
When you press `Save`, this field will be updated in the data source. 

#### 4) Configure the backend
To save user comments, you must specify the API endpoint for the service that updates the data source. You have two options for doing this:  
1) Use Profitbase Flow. This is the easiest option, and only takes a few minutes to set up. 
2) Create an Azure Function and implement the API for saving data to the data source yourself. If you choose this option, you will need a license for the visual.

When you have created the backend, paste the endpoint address into the API Url setting in the Formatting panel.

#### 5) Add a title (Optional, but recommended)
To make it easier for users to understand what they are commenting on, add a title to the visual that displays the selection.  
A simple way to do this, is to add a custom measure to the semantic model table (for example called 'Title'), and use a DAX expression to define the contents, for example

```sql
Title = SELECTEDVALUE(ProjectPlanning[ProjectId], "All projects") & " | " &  FORMAT(SELECTEDVALUE(ProjectPlanning[Period], "All dates"), "MMMM YYYY")
```

Then, select the Title field in `Formatting panel` -> `General` -> `Title`
