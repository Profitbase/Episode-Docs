You can disable expansion for specific rows. A typical use case for this feature is Payroll, where expanding the row might reveal the salary of employees. You still want the salary of employees to be aggregated to the Payroll level in the report, but do not want to allow expansion to view details.

To disable expansion for specific rows, follow these steps
1)	Ensure you are in edit mode
2)	Right click the row you want to disable expansion for
3)	Select “Set allow expansion”
4)	Enable / disable using the checkbox at the top of the visual
