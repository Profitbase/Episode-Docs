You can add custom subtotals to the matrix at any level and define the formula for calculating the value of each column in the subtotal row.

**Note!**  
If the rows from the data model that the custom subtotals are added relative to (before or after) are filtered out, the subtotals will not appear.

To add custom subtotals, perform the following 4 steps (images below):

1. Ensure you are in edit mode (Click in the right upper corner to enter edit mode).
2.	In edit mode, right-click a row where you want to insert a subtotal **before** or **after**.
3.	Enter a name for the row, the “tab” or click in the Formula editor (above the Column headers) to ensure it has focus. Then simply click each row that should make up the calculation. The visual will automatically add the “+” operator between each operand, but you can just change it manually to “-“, “*” or “/”. (minus, multiply or divide).
4.	Optionally, set a custom row style and a format string.
