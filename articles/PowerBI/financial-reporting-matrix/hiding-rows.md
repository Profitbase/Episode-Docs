_**#Premium feature**_ 

You can hide specific rows from being displayed in Report mode. Hiding rows is different from filtering because it allows you to use them in custom subtotal calculations even though they are not visible to the user. If rows are filtered, they cannot be used by custom subtotals.

To hide rows, perform the following 3 steps:
1. Ensure you are in Edit mode.
2. Right-click the row you want to hide (notice a step is added to the **Applied steps** list).
3. Choose **Hide row**.

To make the row visible again, locate the step in the **Applied steps** list and **delete** it.
