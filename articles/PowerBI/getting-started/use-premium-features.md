### Using the visual in Embedded Capacity or want an Enterprise License?


1. To to [our website](https://www.profitbase.no/power-bi-pl-statement/buy-now/) and buy the number of license you need
2. In Power BI Desktop or the Online Editor, go to the **Format pane** and enter the license key

Note that if you download the visual directly from [https://www.profitbase.no/power-bi-pl-statement/download-and-support/](https://www.profitbase.no/power-bi-pl-statement/download-and-support/) and supply your license key, you do not need to enter the license manually every time you add the visual to a report or dashboard.  

However, due to how Power BI works, if you want to **export** the visual to PowerPoint/PDF, you **have to** download from **AppSource**. In that case, you have no choice but to enter the license key every time you use the visual in a dashboard.
