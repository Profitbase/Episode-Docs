### Option 1: Get the visual from AppSource
Install by downloading from [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi-visuals/WA200000642?tab=Overview), or use Power BI Desktop / Web to get it directly from AppSource. 

### Option 2: Download and install the latest version from Github or [Profitbase](https://www.profitbase.com/powerbi)

The most recent version is always available for download from Github or Profitbase long before it's available on AppSource.  
You can download the most recent version from [Github here](https://github.com/Profitbase/PowerBI-visuals-FinancialReportingMatrix/releases) or [Profitbase here](https://www.profitbase.com/powerbi).  

Once you have downloaded the .pbiviz-file to disk, do the following to start using it:  
1) Go into your **Power BI admin portal** and register the visual as an **Organizational visual**.  
```
NOTE!! DO NOT try to import the visual from file to Power BI Desktop or Power BI Service.  
Power BI will just pull down the latest version from AppSource and ignore the file.
```  
2) Switch to your development tool (PBI Desktop or Service), choose "Get more visuals" from the Visualizations pane and import the visual from **My organization** instead of AppSource.
