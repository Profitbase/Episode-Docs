_**#Premium feature**_  

You can configure rows to apply a style when they are expanded. The style will be automatically applied to rows when they are expanded and removed when they are collapsed.  

You configure this behavior in Formatting pane -> **Row expansion** -> **Apply expansion style**.
Ensure that **Apply expansion style** is turned on and then specify the style (Font color, background, font style, etc)
