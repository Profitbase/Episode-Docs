_**#Premium feature**_  

Note! This feature is only available in version 4 and above.

The column expansion feature enables users to collapse and expand columns, for example toggling expanding between Year and Months. You can have as many levels of columns as you want, and you can expand/collapse each column individually.
When a column is collapsed, its children are automatically summarized and the total is displayed. This feature works in conjunction with the Column subtotals feature, so you can have them both enabled and things will work as expected.
