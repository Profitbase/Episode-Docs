All actions you perform when you are in edit mode are added as steps to the Applied Steps list. The order of the steps matter, because they are applied in the order they appear in the list. 

**Example**

If you add a step that sets the style for a row and then in a later step sets a style for a column, the column will override row style for the cells in that column.

You can **move a step up and down** in the Applied steps list by selecting it and then use the Up/Down buttons at the top to change the order.

You can **delete** a step by selecting or hovering the step, and then press the X next to it.

To **edit** an existing step, simply select it in the Applied steps list.
