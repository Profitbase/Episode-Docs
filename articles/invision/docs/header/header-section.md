Once the App Header section is enabled, a new section becomes visible in the designer, allowing the user to add various components to it.

This option let's you to:

- Change the design of the app header toolbar.
- Add custom content to the toolbar.
- Remove extra spacing from the Invision Designer.


> [!NOTE]
> The content is resized to fit the maximum section size of 32px.
