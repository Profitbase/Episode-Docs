## Introduction

Access to resources, such as [Workbooks](../workbooks.md), Data, and APIs are granted to [Access Groups](accessgroups.md). Access Groups contains identity or group accounts from Windows AD or Microsoft Entra ID.

This means that a user is granted access to resources within the application based on which `Access Group` they belong to. You cannot grant permissions to a user directly.

In addition to manging access control through a built-in user interface, it can also be managed through an [HTTP API](httpapi.md). To manage Identities/Groups/Access Control through the API, you need an API Key and the API address.
