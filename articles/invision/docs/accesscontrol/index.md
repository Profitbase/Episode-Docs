### Introduction

Access control is a security technique that regulates who can view or use resources in a computing environment. It is a fundamental concept in security that minimizes risk to the business or organization.

Access to resources, such as [Workbooks](../workbooks.md), Data, and APIs are granted to [Access Groups](accessgroups.md). Access Groups contain (identity or group) accounts from Windows or Azure AD.

To each [Identity](identities.md) and access group, you can grant access by setting Workbook and [Data Permissions](dataperm.md).

Access control can be managed through an [HTTP API](httpapi.md). To manage Identities/Groups/Access Control through the API, you need an API Key and the API address.
