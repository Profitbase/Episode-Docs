# Access Groups

Access to resources, such as [Workbooks](../workbooks.md), Data, and APIs are granted to Access Groups. Access Groups contains identity or group accounts from Windows AD or Microsoft Entra ID.

You can add or import identities.

When you "add" identities, you connect to the identity provider that the system is set up to use (for example Windows or Azure Active Directory).

When you "import" identities, you can paste a list of identities (typically from an Excel file).

## Copy users from Access Group

You can copy users from one Access Group and paste to other Access Groups. If a user already exists, it will not be added to the target Access Group.
