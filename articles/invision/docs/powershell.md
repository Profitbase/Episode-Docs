# PowerShell

With InVision, you can use PowerShell 7 tools to create and run scripts directly within the platform. You don't need to save and run them from a server. You can also install external modules from PowerShell Gallery and NuGet, or from other sources if needed.

Since InVision runs the PowerShell scripts, you can use InVision's APIs and resources, like Directives and SQL Execution Services, to easily define custom business logic and automate processes.
