### Workbooks

Workbooks are the end-user interfaces of InVision. A Workbook consists of one or multiple pages, and each page contains one or more [components](workbooks/components.md), for example, [Worksheets](worksheets.md), [Reports](workbooks/components/reports.md), [Filters](filters.md), [Buttons](workbooks/components/uielements/button.md), [Labels](workbooks/components/uielements/label.md), etc.

A Workbook also has left, top, and right sections which can be used for hosting components that interact with components across many pages, for example, a Save-button or global filters.

<br/>

from version 5.0 you can configure a Workbook to be the landing page of InVision instead of the default system [home page](homepage.md). This enables you to create a fully customized and actionable landing page for users instead of just a Workbook launcher portal.
