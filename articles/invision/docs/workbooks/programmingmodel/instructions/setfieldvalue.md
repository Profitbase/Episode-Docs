### Example

>This example shows how to set the ProductID property of a new row being added to a Worksheet based on the value of a variable.
When a new row is added, the ItemAdded event is raised. The object in context of the event is the new row. The instruction is set a Workbook ExecuteExpression action.

```
SetFieldValue(@Event.Data, "ProductID", _state.SelectedProductID);
```

>**Note** that you can also set the value of the field using the following expression in an ExecuteExpression action:

```
@Event.Data.ProductID = _state.SelectedProductID;
```
