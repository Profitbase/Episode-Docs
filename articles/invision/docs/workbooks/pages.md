### Pages

A [Workbook](../workbooks.md) consists of one or multiple pages, and each page contains one or more components, for example, [Worksheets](../worksheets.md), [Reports](../sqlreports.md), [Filters](../filters.md), [Buttons](components/uielements/button.md), [Labels](components/uielements/label.md), etc.

A Workbook also has left, top, and right sections called dock panes, which can be used for hosting components that interact with components across many pages, for example, global filters.

Pages consist of business logic ([events and actions](programmingmodel/interactionmodel.md)) and components such as [Buttons](../workbooks/components/uielements/button.md), [Filters](../filters.md), and Spreadsheets. Components are added by dragging and dropping items from the toolbox and organized in a grid layout (along rows and columns). You can also split your pages into smaller, more manageable components-[Subscreens](subscreens.md).
