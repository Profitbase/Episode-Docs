# Pages

A [Workbook](../workbooks.md) consists of one or multiple pages, and each page contains one or more components, for example, [Worksheets](../worksheets.md), [Reports](../sqlreports.md), [Filters](../filters/index.md), [Buttons](components/uielements/button.md), [Labels](components/uielements/label.md), etc.

A Workbook also has left, top, and right sections called dock panes, which can be used for hosting components that interact with components across many pages, for example, global filters.

Pages consist of business logic ([events and actions](programmingmodel/interactionmodel.md)) and components such as [Buttons](../workbooks/components/uielements/button.md), [Filters](../filters/index.md), and Spreadsheets. Components are added by dragging and dropping items from the toolbox and organized in a grid layout (along rows and columns). You can also split your pages into smaller, more manageable components-[Subscreens](subscreens.md).

### Displaying pages in popups
In InVision, popups are created by specifying that a page should be displayed in a popup. You configure this behavior from the properties panel of the page.  
[Read more about creating popups here](./howto/popup.md).

### Displaying pages in drawers
A page can be displayed in a drawer, which is a panel that slides in from the right side of the Workbook. Pages displayed in drawers typically contains "tools" or supporting details for the data displayed in the main page.
