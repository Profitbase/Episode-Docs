#### Form Schemas

[Form Schemas](../../forms/formschemas.md) consists of multipe [controls](../../forms/formschemas/controls.md) that are data bound to models which are loaded and saved in a single batch. Form Schemas have their own built-in layout and styling system, validation, event and programming API, but are hosted in [Workbooks](../../workbooks.md) just like any other component.
