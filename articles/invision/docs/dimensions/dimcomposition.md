<br/>

Dimension Composition is a tool to generate a dimension based on the property and property value of members from source dimensions.

You compose a dimension by adding levels and picking members from other dimensions based on their properties. That makes it easy to use different structures for input while still having one uniform reporting structure without having to maintain the same dimension members in multiple dimensions.

<br/>

1. Check out **"Allow Composition"** box in the Options tab, to enable composition for a dimension.
