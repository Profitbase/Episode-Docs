# Time Frame

To enable features such as [Periodic Input](periodicimput.md) and [Rollover](rollover.md), you need to set up the [Time Frame](timeframe.md) configuration for a [Data Store](../datastores.md). The Time Frame is the feature that all date-related information for Data Stores and Settings are derived from, which makes it a very important part of most InVision solutions.
