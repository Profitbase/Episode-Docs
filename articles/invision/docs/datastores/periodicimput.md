# Periodic Input

To enable Periodic Input for Data Stores and Settings, you first need to configure the [Time Frame](timeframe.md) for the repositories or the repository group. A Time Frame can be configured for a Data Store Group or Data Stores and Settings individually. Having configured a valid Time Frame, you need to add [Time Frame](timeframe.md) Measure Columns to the repository. 

[Time Frame Measure Columns](timeframemeasurecolumns.md) are special numeric columns with date/time metadata, which in conjunction with the Time Frame, associates the values of the column with an actual date/time. 

When using [Periodic Input](periodicimput.md), you would usually enable [Rollover](rollover.md) for transitioning to a new period when the current period is completed.
