#### Customization Options

If you want to customize the import and/or update process executed by InVision, you can do this by editing the **«Update Data»** and **«Load Store Data»** [Data Flows](../../dataflows/index.md) found in the System folder for each [Data Store](../../datastores.md). You can edit these Data Flow by adding custom actions as [SQL scripts](../../sqlscripts.md), SSIS packages or custom .NET code.


> [!NOTE]
> that you cannot remove the system generated tasks, but you can disable them.
