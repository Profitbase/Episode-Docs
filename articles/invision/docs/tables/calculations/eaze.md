Eaze formulas are used for executing cell calculations in data grids.

A typical formula has this form: 

``@<target> = <expression>;``

The left hand side of the formula is the address of the cell being calculated, and the right hand side expresses the value to assign to the cell.

````
@Amount[] = Price * Qty
````
