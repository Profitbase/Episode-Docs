#### InVision Directives

InVision Solutions are created using a combination of configuration and scripting. Standard features are set up using configuration, while scripting is used for implementing **custom features**.

InVisions runs on top of Microsoft SQL Server as the database backend, and the .NET framework as the application runtime, which means scripting is usually done using **T-SQL** and **C#**.

InVision directives are used as a bridge between custom scripts and the InVision meta-model and database content, by enabling custom scripts to reference objects, data, and properties in the InVision Solution without having to hard code the values into the custom scripts. This enables custom scripts to stay unchanged as the Solution configuration and state changes.
