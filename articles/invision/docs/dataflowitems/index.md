Data Flow Items are used for defining all kinds of **business logic** that can be executed on the server.  
A single Data Flow Item can execute one or many tasks, which may range from predefined system tasks to custom **SQL** tasks.

In addition to predefined or custom **SQL** tasks, you can embed and execute **C#** code from within a Data Flow or even reference custom **.NET** libraries (.dlls) for execution.
