## Custom Parameters @< Param >



Data Queries can be parameterized without filter linking. You can parameterize any part a custom SQL uery by adding **@< Param >** tags to it. A major difference between using filter directives and custom parameters to filter the returned data set from a query, is that you have to pass values to custom parameters, while itâ€™s optional with filter directives. The reason for this is that InVision rewrites a query by injecting SQL fragments based on any filter directives, while a query with custom parameters is executed as is.  

In addition, you must use custom parameters in Form Element load and save scripts, because filter directives cannot execute in that context while ensuring a unique row is loaded or updated / inserted. 

A custom parameter is just a token added to a SQL expression.

>**Example**
>
        SELECT *  
        FROM MyTable  
        WHERE MyKey = @PKValue 

contains the custom parameter **@PKValue**. 

A value must be passed to @PKValue by using the SetParamValue function when invoking a request from a Workbook.
