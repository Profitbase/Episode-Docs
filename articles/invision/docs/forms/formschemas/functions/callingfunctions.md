# Calling Functions from External Events

You can call a function in a Form Schema from other Workbook components or events by executing the **Execute Function** action on the Form Schema. You can also pass arguments to the function.

To call a function in a Form Schema on some event, for example, a button click, open the interaction editor (from the Events property of the caller object), then find the Form Schema in the **Available Actions** explorer and drag in the **Execute Function** to the **Actions list** as shown below. Then, in the Instructions list, call **Execute(...)** by passing in the name of the function and optionally an argument.
