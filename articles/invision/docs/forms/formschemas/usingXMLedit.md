# Using the XML Editor

The Desktop Designer contains an XML editor for editing different markups. Here are some hits on built-in functions.

## Inserting tags:  
Start typing the opening token < for the tag and a popup will show which tags are available for use. Select a tag and hit enter to enter the tag into the code. 

>**Example**
```
<Layout
```
 
> [!NOTE]
> This tag is still open and ready for adding properties before being closed.

It is recommended to hit the closing token **>** which will add the closing tag to always keep the tags closed so that the XML can be rendered correctly.

>**Example**
```
</Layout>
```

**Enter properties:** 

Place the cursor after the opening tag text and before the closing token and push space bar on your keyboard. This will bring a list of properties that are available for this tag. Select property and hit enter and enter the property value.

>**Example**
```
<Layout[cursor here]>
```
