# Form Schemas

Form Schemas consists of multipe controls that are data bound to models which are loaded and saved in a single batch. Form Schemas have their own built-in layout and styling system, validation, event and programming API, but are hosted in [Workbooks](../workbooks.md) just like any other component.
