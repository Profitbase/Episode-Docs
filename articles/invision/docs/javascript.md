# JavaScript 

By using JavaScript in InVision you can add interactivity and behaviors to static components. For example, you can dynamically change a caption, or use custom JavaScript code to perform spreadsheet calculations instead of using a standard Eaze formulas. In many cases you can either write an inline function or provide the name of a function from a JavaScript defined in the solution.
