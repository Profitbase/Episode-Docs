# JavaScript 

By using JavaScript in InVision you can add interactivity and behaviors to static components. For example, you can dynamically change a caption, or when you want / need to use a custom JavaScript library to perform the spreadsheet calculations instead of using a standard formula. In many cases you can either write an inline function or provide the name of a function from a JavaScript defined in the solution.
<br/>

Previously, JavaScripts defined in one Solution would be loaded to Workbooks in other Solutions as well. This is no longer the case, from version 5.0 JavaScripts will only be loaded to Workbooks that are in the same Solution.
