# Upgrade Package

Installed Packages can be upgraded to newer versions. When a Package is upgraded, the currently installed version of the Package is deleted before the new version is installed. This means that any customizations made to the Package will be lost. 


> [!NOTE]
> Any external extensions referencing objects in the Package will continue to work after the upgrade has completed.
