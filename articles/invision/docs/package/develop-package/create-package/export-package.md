You can export Packages that you have created, but you cannot export Packages that has been **deployed** into a Solution.
<br/>



### Export Package

1. Open a Solution and find the Package that you want to export.
2. In the Package editor screen, press **Create package**. This will create a `.pbpck` file that you can deploy to a different Solution, or use in a Package Upgrade project.
