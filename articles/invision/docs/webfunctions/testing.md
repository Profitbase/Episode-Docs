### Testing Web Functions

<br/>

You can test Web Functions in the Test tab, where you can:

- Choose HTTP Method

  - You can examine the request parameter in the Run method and choose different actions based on the HTTP Method used for calling the API.

- Specify the query string of the request

  - You can extract the query string values from the request parameter in the Run method.

- Specify headers sent with the request

  - You can extract headers from the request parameter in the Run method.

- Request Body

  - The Request Body is a Json Object that can be passed along with the request with HTTP Methods POST, PUT and PATCH.

When you execute a Web Function from the Test panel, the result is displayed as text in the Test Result pane. If you use the Logging API, the log messages will be displayed in the Log pane at the bottom.
