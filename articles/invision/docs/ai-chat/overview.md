## Get started
To use the AI chat component, do the following
1) Create the backend to the AI chat using Flow. This is where you define which chat model (LLM) to use, how chat history is handled, and how domain knowledge about your business is provided to the chat model.
2) In the Solution Explorer, add an AI chat object to the solution.
3) In the AI chat solution object, select the Flow you created in Step 1.
4) Open the Workbook designer and add the AI chat to a page.
