# Intuitive web-based applications

<br/>

Profitbase InVision is a low-code empowering users to swiftly and effectively create adaptable business apps on a modern and robust technology stack. Users can leverage the platform's comprehensive standard components to develop a wide range of solutions, including user interfaces and back-end services. This streamlined approach significantly reduces both cost and time when implementing projects.

Users utilize the Profitbase InVision Designer to construct applications, which are subsequently published as web applications within the organization. These web applications require minimal or no training to operate effectively.

Within a matter of minutes, users can install pre-built modules, and optionally customize them to precisely meet the specific requirements of the business.

Profitbase InVision seamlessly integrates with other business systems through REST APIs or direct connection to the SQL data storage, facilitating effortless connectivity.

# Solution

A solution contains all of the data and configuration for your application, such as business logic, data stores, workbooks, worksheets, data flows, workflows, etc.

**Clone Solution**

You can easily clone entire Solutions from the Designer start page. Cloning a Solution will also copy input data from the source Solution, permissions, and Data Flow schedules. 

> [!NOTE]
> that objects in cloned Solutions are not automatically added to the Data Pool after the cloning has been completed. They will, however, be added to the Data Pool if the Data Pool Compound View is rebuilt. If you don’t want this to happen, you need to edit your newly cloned Solution and remove the Data Pool configuration from the objects that you don’t want as members of the Data Pool.
 
<br/>

**When creating a new Solution**

Creating a new Solution requires specifying whether the Solution should provide contents to Work Process blueprints or not. This change was added because it was too easy to forget to set this property after a Package had been deployed.
