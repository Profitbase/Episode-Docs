### Hello learner!

In this part of the documentation, you will find videos showing features and tools that you can find in Profitbase InVision.  

All videos contain talking bubbles. When displayed, the video will pause for 5 seconds.

If the pause is too short, we suggest you simply pause the video manually.

We hope that our videos will be helpful to you.

For more detailed descriptions, go to our [DOCS](docs.md) section.
