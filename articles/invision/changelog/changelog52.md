# InVision 5.2 change log

<br/>

## New Features

<br/>

### File Storage

This cool new feature enables rich file/document management. The component can be used to upload, store, download, and delete any type of file.
File access can be managed by associating files to dimensions, filters, or any custom attribute. We currently support Azure Blob Storage and disk as file stores.

<br/>

### Multiple Access Control enhancements

- Added support for copying permissions for identities
- Introduced categorization (Default, Role, Data) of Access Group.  
  Access Groups in the Default category can be used to assign permissions to both Workbooks and Dimensions.
  Role Access Groups can only be assigned to Workbooks. Data Access Groups can only be assigned to Dimensions.
- Intermediate/padded levels in ragged dimensions are skipped when rendering dimensions in the Access Control editors
- Access Groups can be created directly from the Data Access Control screen when assigning permissions to a dimension member
- You can now switch between all available Solutions in the Workbook or Data Permissions screens when configuring permissions (no need for separate Workbooks for each Solution, or having to use the Designer)

<br/>

### Monitoring and logging API

We added support for a REST API for reading logs from the system, including application, data flow, and background agent logs.
This feature enables enterprise IT departments to integrate InVision into their operations management.
