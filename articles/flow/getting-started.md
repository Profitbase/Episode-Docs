# Getting started

This getting started guide outlines the main steps required to creating and running your first Flow.

### 1. Create a Workspace
Start by [creating a Workspace](./workspaces/create-workspace.md).
Before you can create any Flows, you need to have at least one [Workspace](./workspaces.md). A Workspace is a logical container of Flows and artifacts that belong together. Within a Workspace, you can organize Flows into Folders if the number of Flows becomes large. To edit an existing Flow, open the Workspace it belongs to, then select the Flow you want to edit.

### 2. [Optional] Grant other users permissions to the Workspace
When you create a Workspace, you (the creator) will automatically be granted access to it. By default, tenant administrators have access to all Workspaces. If you want other (non-admin) users to have access to the Workspace, you must explicitly grant them access.  
[Read more here.](./workspaces/workspace-access-control.md)  

### 3. Create a Flow

With your Workspace created, you can now [create a Flow](./flows/create-flow.md).

## Run Flows
There are multiple ways to run a Flow. The links below describe how to run Flows during development, in production, and from third-party apps.

[Run a Flow from the Flow Designer](./flows/running-flows/from-designer.md)  
[Run a Flow from a trigger](./flows/running-flows/from-events-in-external-systems.md)  
[Run a Flow from a 3rd party app](./flows/running-flows/from-third-party-app.md)  
[Run a Flow on a schedule](./flows/running-flows/run-scheduled.md)  

[Run a Flow from an InVision Workbook](../invision/docs/flows/how-to/run-flow-from-workbook.md)  
[Run a Flow from an InVision Form](../invision/docs/flows/how-to/run-flow-from-form-schema.md)
