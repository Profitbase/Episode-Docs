# Getting started

This getting started guide outlines the main steps required to creating and running your first Flow.

1. [Create a Workspace](./workspaces/create-workspace.md) if you don't already have one.
Before you can create any Flows, you need to have at least one [Workspace](./workspaces.md). A Workspace is a logical container of Flows and artifacts that belong together, and there is no restriction on how many Flows a Workspace can contain. Within a Workspace, you can choose to organize Flows in Folders if the number of Flows get large. If you have an existing Flow that you want to edit, you need to open the Workspace it belongs to and then select the Flow you want to edit.

2. [Optional] [Grant permissions to the Workspace](./workspaces/workspace-access-control.md)  
Tenant admins have access to all Workspaces. If you want non-admin users to have access to a Workspace, you need to explicitly grant them access to the Workspace.

3. [Create a Flow](./flows/create-flow.md)  

## Run Flows


[Run a Flow from the Flow Designer](./flows/running-flows/from-designer.md)  
[Run a Flow from a trigger](./flows/running-flows/from-events-in-external-systems.md)  
[Run a Flow from a 3rd party app](./flows/running-flows/from-third-party-app.md)  
[Run a Flow on a schedule](./flows/running-flows/run-scheduled.md)  

[Run a Flow from an InVision Workbook](../invision/docs/flows/how-to/run-flow-from-workbook.md)  
[Run a Flow from an InVision Form](../invision/docs/flows/how-to/run-flow-from-form-schema.md)
