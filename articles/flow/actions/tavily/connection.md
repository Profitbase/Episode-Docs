# Tavily Connection
 
The connection is a required part of the configuration of [Tavily](https://docs.tavily.com/) actions and tools.
 
<br/>

## Creating a New Connection
 
When adding a Tavily action (such as [Foreach web search result](foreach-web-search-result.md)), you can select an **existing Tavily connection** or **create a new one**:
 
1. Click on a Tavily action in order to open the Properties panel.
2. Click on the Connection field to select or create a connection. In the popup that shows up click on the **New connection** button.
3. Fill out the required connection fields (Name and API key).
 
<br/>

## Properties
 
| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Name | A custom label for the connection. This name will appear in dropdowns when selecting the connection in actions. |
| API Key | The Tavily API key for authentication. This key authorizes requests from Flow to Tavily's endpoints. |
 
**Important:**  
- API keys can be created and managed in the [Tavily Dashboard](https://app.tavily.com/).  
- Keep your key private, as it grants access to your Tavily usage quota and billing.
