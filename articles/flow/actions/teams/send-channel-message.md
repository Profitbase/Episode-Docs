## Properties

| Name           | Type           | Description                        |
|----------------|----------------|------------------------------------|
| Connection     | Required       | The [connection](./connection.md) to the Teams account. Setting up a connection requires a **Microsoft Work or School account**.|
| Team (ID)      | Required       | The ID of the team that the channel belongs to. |
| Channel (ID)   | Required       | The ID of the channel to send the message to. |
| Message        | Required       | The message to send. This can be a plain text message, or a HTML message. If it is a HTML message, remember to set the `Message content type` property to `HTML`. |
| Message content type | Optional | Specifies whether the message content is Text or HTML. |
| Attachments    | Optional       | The attachments to include in the message. Note that in Teams, an "attachment" is a reference to an _existing_ document in OneDrive / SharePoint, so you cannot include a _file_ as an _attachment_ directly. Instead, if you want to include a file (from a stream or byte array), you must used `Hosted content` instead. |
