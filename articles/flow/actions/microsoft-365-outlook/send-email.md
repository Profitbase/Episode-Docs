# Send email

Sends an email using Microsoft 365 Outlook.

Use this action to send emails from a `personal` Microsoft 365 Outlook mailbox. To do this, you need to create a [Microsoft 365 Outlook connection](./outlook-connection.md) to grant Profitbase Flow permissions to use the personal account on behalf of the user.

> [!CAUTION]
> Consider carefully whether to use a personal or [shared mailbox](./send-email-from-shared-mailbox.md). You decide this when you create the Microsoft 365 Outlook connection.  
> If you work in a Workspace shared with other people, they can use the same connection to read, send, delete and update mail messages.  
> We recommend using shared mailboxes, or log on using a service user account (such as a company support account).
