# Send email from shared mailbox

Sends an email from a shared mailbox using Microsoft 365 Outlook.

Use this action to send emails from a `shared` Microsoft 365 Outlook mailbox. If you don't already have one, you need to first create a [Microsoft 365 Outlook connection](./outlook-connection.md) by logging on with an account having access to the shared mailbox.
