# Save DeltaSet

Saves all changes in a DeltaSet to a Snowflake table.

A typical use case for this action is to save the changes made by users in the [Writeback Table](../../../PowerBI/writeback-table/overview.md) for Power BI. This action will save all changes made by the user in Power BI by either inserting, updating, or deleting rows in the Snowflake target table.

| Property                 | Description                          |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Column name              | The name of the column that you want to specify a behavior for.  |
| Use as update or delete key | By enabling this option, Flow will match by this column when updating or deleting rows instead of using the columns defined as keys in the [DeltaCells](../../api-reference/built-in-types/deltaset.md#deltacell).  |
| Allow updating data in this column | You can set this option to `false` to explicitly prevent this column from being updated, even though the DeltaSet contains changes for the column.   |
| Enable identity insert  | Not applicable for Snowflake. |
