## Properties

| Name           | Type           | Description                        |
|----------------|----------------|------------------------------------|
| Connection     | Required       | The [connection](./connection.md) to the Teams account. Setting up a connection requires a **Microsoft Work or School account**.|
| User (ID)      | Required       | The ID of the user to send the message to. This can be the `Object ID (OID)` or the `user principal name (UPN)` of the user in **Microsoft Entra ID**  |
| Message        | Required       | The message to send. This can be a plain text message, or a HTML message. If it is a HTML message, remember to set the `Message content type` property to `HTML`. |
| Message content type | Optional | Specifies whether the message content is Text or HTML. |
| Attachments    | Optional       | The attachments to include in the message. Note that in Teams, an "attachment" is a reference to an _existing_ document in OneDrive / SharePoint, so you cannot include a _file_ as an _attachment_ directly. Instead, if you want to include a file (from a stream or byte array), you must used `Hosted content` instead. |

### Examples

The example below describes sending a message with an attachment using the [Send message in channel](./send-channel-message.md) action, but the approach is exactly the same for `Send chat message`.
