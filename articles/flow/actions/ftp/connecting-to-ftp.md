# FTP & SFTP Connection

To use FTP or SFTP actions in [Profitbase Flow](https://docs.profitbase.com/articles/flow/actions/ftp/delete-file.html), you need to create a connection to the FTP/SFTP server.

This guide outlines how to configure and test a new FTP or SFTP connection.

<br/>

## Creating a New Connection

When adding an FTP or SFTP action, you will be prompted to select or create a connection. To create a new one, enable **Create new connection** and fill in the required details.

<br/>

### Connection Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Name | A custom name for the connection. This name will be displayed in Flow when selecting the connection. |
| Connection Type | Choose either **FTP** or **SFTP** depending on your server protocol. |
| Host name | The address of your FTP or SFTP server (e.g., `ftp.myserver.com`). |
| Port number | (Optional) Port number to connect to. Default is `21` for FTP and `22` for SFTP. |
| Username | Username required for authentication on the server. |
| Password | Password corresponding to the username above. |
| Connection timeout (seconds) | (Optional) Duration before the connection attempt times out. |

<br/>

## Testing the Connection

After filling out the form:

1. Click **Test connection** to verify if the server is reachable and the credentials are correct.
2. If the connection succeeds, click **Ok** to save it.
3. If the connection fails, verify the hostname, port, username, and password.
