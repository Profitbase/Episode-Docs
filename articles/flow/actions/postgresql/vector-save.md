# Save vectors 

Saves vectors in PostgreSQL database based on input text.


![img](../../../../images/flow/vector-save.png)

**Example** ![img](../../../../images/strz.jpg)  
This flow [reads](../onedrive/read-file-from-onedrive-as-byte-array.md) files from OneDrive, [converts](../built-in/convert.md) their content to text, [splits](../ai/text-splitter.md) it into chunks, generates [embedding](../azure-ai/text-embedder.md) vectors, and stores them in a PostgreSQL database for semantic search.


<br/>

This action allows saving a text as a list of records in a PostgreSQL vector collection, in a specific format (Profitbase). This is done using the following steps:
1. **Split** - The input text is split into chunks using the Text splitter (link).
2. **Embed** - Each of the chunks resulting from the previous step is embedded using the Text embedder (link)
3. **Build** - A new collection record is built for each of the embedded chunk.
4. **Upsert** - The newly created record is inserted in the database collection.

## Collection Schema

The collection has the following columns:

- **key** *(String)*:  
  Contains the record's key. This is automatically generated by the node.

- **content** *(String)*:  
  Contains the plain-text of a chunk.

- **vector** *(Vector)*:  
  Contains the vector representation of the `content` column.

- **context** *(String)*:  
  Contains the context of the text inputted in the node. This can be a document name, a URL, or a generic ID representing the resource to which the text pertains.

- **additional columns**:  
  For each custom column defined in the node, a new collection column will be created (including the specified data type).


> [!NOTE]
> In order to use this action, make sure that your Postgres instance has the **pgvector** extension installed.
