# PostgreSQL Connection

To interact with a PostgreSQL database using actions in **Profitbase Flow**, you need to either select an existing connection or create a new one.

This guide explains how to configure a PostgreSQL connection and what each field means.

## ðŸ”§ Connection Details

A PostgreSQL connection requires the following fields:

| Field                         | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| Name                     | A custom name for the connection. This will be shown when selecting it in Flow actions. |
| Connection / Authentication Type | Choose between `PostgreSQL Authentication` or a `Custom Connection String`. |
| Server Name              | The hostname or IP address of your PostgreSQL server. |
| Database Name            | The name of the specific database to connect to. |
| Username                 | The database user used for authentication. |
| Password                 | The password for the specified user. |
| Connection Timeout (optional) | Number of seconds before the connection attempt times out. Default is 60 seconds. |

<br/>

## Configuration Steps

1. Provide a **Name** for the connection.
2. Select the **Authentication Type**:
   - `PostgreSQL Authentication` â€“ Fill in server, database, username, and password.
   - `Custom Connection String` â€“ Paste a full connection string with credentials and parameters.
3. Fill in the **Server Name**, **Database Name**, **Username**, and **Password**.
4. (Optional) Set a **Connection Timeout** if needed.
5. Click **Test Connection** to verify the setup.
6. If the test is successful, click **OK** to save the connection.

## Notes and Best Practices

- Ensure the PostgreSQL server is reachable from your network.
- Use strong credentials and rotate passwords regularly.
-  Keep the default timeout unless your environment requires a longer or shorter duration.
- If connecting through a firewall, ensure the relevant port (default is `5432`) is open.
