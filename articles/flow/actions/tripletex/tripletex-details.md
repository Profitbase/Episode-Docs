# Tripletex API Guide  

## Returns  

The return type for Tripletex API actions is defined during configuration. It can be either:  
- A **custom data type**, or  
- The raw JSON response from the API.  

For simplicity and debugging, itâ€™s recommended to use the built-in `HttpResponse<T>` type. This includes additional information, such as the HTTP status code, ensuring compatibility with Tripletex API responses.  

To process the data effectively:  
1. Store the raw response in a data repository (e.g., database or cloud storage).  
2. Transform the stored data using tools like SQL, Python, or data transformation pipelines.

## Configuration  

### Setting Up a Request  

Requests to the Tripletex API can be defined manually or by using predefined templates.  

#### Steps for Manual Configuration:  
1. **Method**: Specify the HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.). Use `GET` for retrieving data.  
2. **URI**: Define the endpoint URL (e.g., `v2/project` or `v2/customer`). Pass required parameters (e.g., IDs) as query parameters or in the request body.  
3. **Headers and Authorization**:  
   - Include an authentication header:  
     ```http
     Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
     ```  
   - Ensure proper encoding of any additional headers.  
4. **Response Type**: Use `HttpResponse<string>` by default for raw JSON responses. For large responses, this minimizes memory usage and improves performance.  

For endpoint-specific details, refer to the [Tripletex API documentation](https://tripletex.no/v2-docs/).

## Response Paging  

Tripletex APIs often return paginated responses for large datasets. For example, list endpoints like `v2/project` or `v2/customer` include pagination metadata (e.g., `next`, `totalCount`).  

To handle paging:  
- Use the `next` link from the API response to fetch subsequent pages.  
- Repeat until no further pages are available.  

Ensure your API client or workflow can handle this iterative process effectively.

## API Limits  

Tripletex enforces rate limits to manage server load. If you exceed these limits, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` error.  

### Best Practices for Handling API Limits:  
- Implement a retry mechanism with an exponential backoff strategy.  
- Optimize queries to fetch only necessary data.  
- Monitor API usage to avoid hitting the limit during peak periods.

By following these guidelines, you can integrate with the Tripletex API efficiently and avoid common pitfalls.
