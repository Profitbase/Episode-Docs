# Overview
Flow includes support for building AI solutions using Microsoft Foundry models, such as recommendation systems, AI chats and agents.  

To get started, you first need to create a [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com) project and deploy a model. Then, you can start building Flows for [chat completion](./chat-completion.md), RAG systems using [text embeddings](./generate-embedding.md) and [AI agents](../agents/tools-ai-agent.md) utilizing tools.
