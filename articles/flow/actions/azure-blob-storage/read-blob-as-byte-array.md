# Read Blob as byte array

Reads the contents of an [Azure Blob](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/) into memory as a byte array. You can compare this to downloading a file. For peformance reasons, prefer using [streaming](read-blob-as-stream.md) over reading as byte array if possible. Streaming is generally faster and uses less memory, because streaming doesn't require loading the entire blob into memory before you can start working with the data.

**Example** ![img](../../../../images/strz.jpg)  
This flow iterates through blob files in Azure Blob Storage, checks if each file is an Excel file, reads the valid Excel files as byte arrays, and then converts those byte arrays into DataTables for further processing. Used actions: [For each Blob name](foreach-blob-name.md), [If](../built-in/if.md). [Read Blob as byte array]().

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to read the file multiple times, for example processing its contents and then sending the file somewhere else (such as to an archive), you MUST use the byte array option instead of streaming because the stream can only read once.

Once you have the blob contents, you must _load_ it using a compatible action in order to make use of the data.

For example, an Excel file can be loaded using the [Open Excel file as DataReader](../excel/open-excel-file-as-datareader.md), [Read Excel file as DataTable](../excel/read-excel-file-as-datatable.md), or [For each row in Excel file](../excel/for-each-row.md) actions. Once loaded, you can start working with the data in the Excel file.

> [!CAUTION]
> Trying to load a byte array using an incompatible action will fail.

| Name             | Type      |Description                                             |
|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Connection       | Required  | The [Azure Blob container connection](./azure-blob-container-connection.md). The currently supported options are `SAS URI` and `Connection string + container name`.    |
| Dynamic connection | Optional   | A connection dynamically created using the [Create Azure Blob container connection](./create-azure-blob-container-connection.md) action.    |
| Blob name prefix | Optional  | To filter the list of blobs, specify a string for the [prefix parameter](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-list#filter-results-with-a-prefix). **Note!** The prefix is case sensitive. |
| Result variable name | Required | The name of the Flow variable that contains the list of the blob names. |
