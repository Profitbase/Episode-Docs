**Example** ![img](../../../../images/strz.jpg)  
This flow reads data from a Google BigQuery database using a forward-only data reader and processes the result as a stream.  
It executes a SQL query, exposes the result as a **DataReader**, and passes that reader to downstream actions that consume the data sequentially, such as formatting the result and uploading it as a file.
