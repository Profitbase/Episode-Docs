# Create Visma Business NXT connection

This action creates a connection for Visma Business NXT, and is intented for dynamically connecting to different subscriptions based on parameters or conditions during the execution of a Flow.   

If you store the credentials for the Visma Business NXT outside Flow (for example in your own Azure SQL or PostgreSQL database), use this action to _dynamically_ create a connection. The connection returned from the action must then be used as the input to the `Dynamic connection` property of a Visma Business NXT GraphQL action.
