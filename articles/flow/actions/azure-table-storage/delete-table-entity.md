**Example** ![img](../../../../images/strz.jpg)  
This flow [iterates](foreach-table-entity.md) through each employee in an Azure Table, checks if theyâ€™ve been inactive for over 12 months based on `lastLoginDate`, and deletes them. It processes each employee one by one, then ends with a 'Done' step once all are evaluated.
