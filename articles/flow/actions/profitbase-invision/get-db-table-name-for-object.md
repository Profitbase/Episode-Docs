This flow retrieves the name of a database table, converts the result to a [CSV file](../csv/create-csv-file-as-stream.md), and [uploads](../azure-blob-storage/upload-blob.md) that CSV to Azure Blob Storage. The flow is designed for automated data exports and supports large datasets through streaming.
