**Example** ![img](../../../../images/strz.jpg)  
This flow redeploys stored procedures defined in an InVision solution.  
It is triggered via [HTTP](../../triggers/http-trigger.md), [retrieves](../sql-server/get-datareader.md) all stored procedures for the specified solution, [iterates](../built-in/foreach.md) through them, and recreates each stored procedure in the target environment based on its current InVision definition. The flow [logs](../built-in/log.md) the result of each deployment as it progresses.
