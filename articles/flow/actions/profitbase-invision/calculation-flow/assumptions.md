# Assumptions

Assumptions are used to define any type of parameters for (financial) calculations, for example VAT, tax percent, currency exchange rates, and so on.
Technically, an assumption object is made up of one or more keys (for example dimensions members), and one or more values.

A simplified assumption for employer tax may look like this:  

| Country           | State              | Employer tax           |
|-------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Norway            | All                | 14.1 %                 |
| Norway            | Svalbard           | 0 %                    |
| Sweden            | All                | 20.6 %                 |
| United States     | All                | 15.3 %                 |
