# Auto transactions

Auto Transactions enable the definition of one or more transactions derived from a source transaction or entity.    
A typical use case for using Auto Transactions is when working with driver based (financial) models. Business drivers, such as `Human Resources`, almost always comprise sub items such as salary, health insurance, retirement plans, life insurance and so more. By using Auto Transactions, you can establish a "master-details" relationship between an entity and its sub-items. This allows for automatic generation of sub-items into your budget, forecast, or any other dataset, eliminating the need for manual entry at a granular level.


## Properties  

| Name         | Type             | Description                                                |
|--------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Key columns  | Optional         | All Auto Transaction tables must have at least one logical key. If no Primary Key is defined on the table in InVision, or you want to use a different set of columns to make up the key, you can specify the key manually here. Flow uses the key to find which Auto Transactions rows to return from the `FilterByContext()` and `FilterByContextDistinctByTypeId()` methods. |
| Data         | Optional         | Specifies the fields / columns from the Auto Transaction table that you want to use for business logic. By default, all non-key columns are automatically available.                                                   |
| Key mappings | Optional         | Use this option to define explicit mapping between the `Key columns` and the (corresponding) columns in the data source when names does not match. Flow determines which Auto Transactions to use by comparing the values in the `Key columns` to the corresponding columns in the input row from the data source. If not specified otherwise, it matches against columns with the same name. If you need a different behavior, you need to specify the mapping between the keys explicitly. |
| Auto Transaction type | Optional | Specifies the name of the column that defines the Auto Transaction type. You can consider Auto Transaction type as a way to categorize Auto Transactions. For example "Company car" may be a type in the "Employee benefits" Auto Transactions table.  | 

## Using Auto Transactions to produce calculated rows

To use Auto Transactions to produce calculated rows, create a Flow and add the following actions  
1) Define Auto Transactions to use
2) Add a [Calculation Flow db output](define-calculation-flow-db-output.md) action
3) Add a [Calculation Flow db input](read-calculation-flow-db-input.md) action
4) Add a [Function](../../built-in/function.md) action and call `Assumptions.UseContext(...)` (see example below).
5) Add a [Function](../../built-in/function.md) action and implement the calculations (see example below).

**Set processing context**  
From step 4) above, we need to set the context on the Auto Transactions search index so that when we call [FilterByContext()](auto-transactions/auto-transaction-filter-by-context.md) or [FilterByContextDistinctByTypeField()](auto-transactions/auto-transaction-filter-by-context-distinct-by-type-field.md), we get back the Auto Transaction _definitions_ that should be used to generate the Auto Transactions for the current context (for example department, employee or account).

```csharp

private void SetProcessingContext(MyWorkspace.ForecastInput input)
{
    this.AutoTransactions.UseContext(input);
}

```


**Calculate Auto Transactions**  

```csharp
private void Calculate(MyWorkspace.ForecastInput input)
{
    // Returns which employee benefits to generate for the given context.
    foreach(var autoTrans in this.AutoTransactions.EmployeeBenefits.FilterByContextDistinctByTypeField())
    {
        this.Output.Add(AccountID: autoTrans.TargetAccountID, Amount: input.Amount * autoTrans.Factor);
    }
}
```
 

## API

| Name                            | Description                                  |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| [FilterByContext(bool)](auto-transactions/auto-transaction-filter-by-context.md)           | Returns the Auto Transactions having keys matching the key of the data source input row currently used as context. | 
| [FilterByContextDistinctByTypeField(bool)](auto-transactions/auto-transaction-filter-by-context-distinct-by-type-field.md) | Returns the Auto Transactions having keys matching the key of the data source input row currently used as context, in addition to also filtering by the `Auto Transaction type` property. If you have specified the `Auto transaction type` property, you must use this API to avoid the possibility of getting multiple matches pr Auto Transaction type. |
| UseContext(input)               |                                              |
| Set{FieldId}Context(string)     | Sets the value used for matching against {FieldId} in the Auto Transaction table. For example, `SetDepartmentIDContext("a")` will set "a" as the value to match against the `DepartmentID` field in the Auto Transaction table. Use the `Get{FieldId}Context()` and `Set{FieldId}Context()` when you need to change the search context on a granular level, for example if you generate Auto Transactions in a Distribution Key loop.  |
| Get{FieldId}Context()           | Gets the value value used for matching against {FieldId} in the Auto Transactions table. For example `GetDepartmentIDContext()` returns the `department id` that is used for matching against the `DepartmentID` field in the Auto Transaction table. |
| DecayFactor                     | Used to calculate the `match score` for each Auto Transaction row returned by [FilterByContext(bool)](auto-transactions/auto-transaction-filter-by-context.md) or [FilterByContextDistinctByTypeField(bool)](auto-transactions/auto-transaction-filter-by-context-distinct-by-type-field.md). The default value is 0.5. |
