# Update files context in File Storage

Updates the context of multiple files in an InVision File Storage.  

Use this operation for batch operations when you need to update the context of multiple files.

A `context` defines what a file is associated with, for example a project, employee or product. The context can be a composite definition, meaning it can be associated with a combination of multiple entities such as a project, employee AND product.
