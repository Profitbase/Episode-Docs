**Example** ![img](../../../../../images/strz.jpg)  
This flow updates the context of a file only if it currently has no context. It starts with **Get file info from File Storage**, which retrieves metadata for the specified file and stores it in fileInfo. Next, [If action](../../built-in/if.md) checks whether the file’s context is empty or not defined. If the condition is True meaning no context exists the flow calls [Update context of a file in File Storage](update-file-context-in-file-storage.md), passing the fileReferenceId and the provided fileContext. This assigns a context to the file. If the condition is False, nothing happens and the flow continues without changes.
