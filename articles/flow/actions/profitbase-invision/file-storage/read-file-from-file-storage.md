This flow takes a PDF file from File Storage, sends it to the [Adobe PDF Services](https://opensource.adobe.com/pdftools-sdk-docs/release/latest/index.html) as a [byte array](../../adobe/pdf-to-non-pdf-as-byte-array.md), where it is converted into a DOCX format, and then [uploads](../../onedrive/upload-file-to-onedrive.md) it to the selected folder in OneDrive.
