**Example** ![img](../../../../images/strz.jpg)  
This flow demonstrates how an AI agent uses the **Flow AI tool** to invoke another flow as part of handling a chat request. The agent processes the user message using a chat model and maintains conversation context in memory ([AI agent memory](../sql-server/agent-memory.md)). The connected flow is always invoked through the **Flow AI tool**, and the called flow is exposed using the [Flow AI tool trigger](../../triggers/ai/flow-ai-tool-trigger.md). The result is then used by the agent to generate and [return](../built-in/return.md) the final response to the caller.

> [!NOTE]
>  You can only select Flows with a [Flow AI tool trigger](../../triggers/ai/flow-ai-tool-trigger.md).
