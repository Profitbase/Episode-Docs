# Get SIE file stream

This action retrieves a [Standard Import Export (SIE)](https://sie.se/in-english/) file and returns it as a stream object. 
Use this action to retrieve opening/closing balances, transactions, vouchers etc. from Fortnox.

The Swedish **SIE (Standard Import and Export)** file format is an open, text-based standard for transferring accounting data between different software systems in Sweden, acting as a de facto standard for companies, accountants, and auditors to exchange financial information like balances, transactions, and account details, with different types (SIE 1, 2, 3, 4) for varying data levels.
