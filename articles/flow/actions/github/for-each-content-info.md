### Limitations

GitHub [limits](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28) the number of REST API requests that you can make within a specific amount of time.

You can make unauthenticated requests if you are only fetching public data. Unauthenticated requests are associated with the originating IP address, not with the user or application that made the request.
The primary rate limit for unauthenticated requests is 60 requests per hour.

For authenticated users the rate limit is 5,000 requests per hour. If the installation is on a GitHub Enterprise Cloud organization, it has a rate limit of 15,000 requests per hour.


### Authentication

Authentication is done with an authentication token. Click [here](https://docs.catalyst.zoho.com/en/tutorials/githubbot/java/generate-personal-access-token/) for more on creating a token.


### Filter

Filters are based on [Regular Expressions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference) (Reg.Ex).

**Example**
To specify a filter that only returns Markdown (.md) files, use the following regex:
```
/\.md$/
```
