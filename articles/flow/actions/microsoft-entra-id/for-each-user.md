# For each user

Lists all users in a Microsoft Entra ID tenant.

![Example Flow](../../../../images/flow/entra-id-for-each-user-example.png)

**Example** ![img](../../../../images/strz.jpg)  
This flow iterates through all existing users in a Microsoft Entra ID tenant. For each user, it checks if their email address exists within a predefined list of emails to be invited. If a match is found, the address is removed from the invitation list. Finally, the flow loops through the remaining email addresses on the list and sends each a guest invitation to join the tenant.
