#### Generate a PDF file with tabular data
This video shows how to generate a PDF file with tabular data using the Adobe PDF Services API, and download the generated file from an InVision Workbook.  
It uses the [HTTP trigger](../../triggers/http-trigger.md) and [Return File HTTP Response](./return-file-http-response.md) actions to handle the request and return the file.
