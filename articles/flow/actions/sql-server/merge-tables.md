# Merge tables

Merges data from a SQL Server source table or view into a target table.  
This action provides a lightweight wrapper for the [Merge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/merge-transact-sql) statement in SQL Server. If you need to perform a complex MERGE statement, use the [Execute command](execute-command.md) action and write a custom MERGE statement.
