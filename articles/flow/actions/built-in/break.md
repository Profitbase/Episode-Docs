# Break

Terminates (exits) the closest enclosing [Foreach](foreach.md) or [While](while.md) loop.

This flow continuously checks if the system is in maintenance mode, and immediately exits the loop using a Break node when maintenance is detected, allowing the process to continue with alternate actions outside the loop.
