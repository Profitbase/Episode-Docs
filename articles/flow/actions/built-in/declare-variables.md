# Declare variables

Declares multiple variables simultaneously to store data while the Flow is executing.

- You can declare as many variables as you want.
- Variables can be either `global` or `local` (default). Local variables can be used only within the scope it is declared in. Global variables can be used in the entire Flow, both types within [Functions](function.md) and Extension flowcharts.
- Each variable needs to have a type to be valid. (It will not appear in variable selectors, for example, if you try to use it as an argument to a [Function](function.md)). 

 > [!NOTE] 
 > This is true for both `global`and `local` variables.
