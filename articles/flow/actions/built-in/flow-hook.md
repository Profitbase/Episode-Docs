# Hook

Defines an interface for extensions. 

`Hooks` are placeholders in a flowchart where custom logic can be plugged in without modifying the flowchart itself. Instead, users can create an `Extension flowchart` and define the custom business logic there.   
It enables product teams to create and distribute a Flow as part of a standard product, while allowing customers to extend its functionality without breaking the standard implementation. 

You can also use Hooks and [Hook handlers](flow-hook-handler.md) to split a large Flow into smaller flowcharts.

To implement the business logic of a Hook, use a [Hook handler](flow-hook-handler.md) in an `Extension flowchart`, and define the business logic there.

In the example below, the actions are executed in the following order:  

```mermaid

flowchart LR
MainAction1[Main action 1] --> CustomBusinessLogic[Custom business logic] --> MainAction2[Main action 2]

```

Hooks and Hook handlers are simply control flow routing mechanisms, and does not do any actual work.
