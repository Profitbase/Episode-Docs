# Await for each

Iterates over an asynchronous stream of items.

Await foreach processes items as they become available, and if items are produced asynchronously with independent completion times, the observed order can appear random. 

The items source is expected to be of type [IAsyncEnumerable<T>](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.iasyncenumerable-1)
