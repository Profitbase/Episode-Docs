![te](../../../../images/flow/throw-exception.png)

**Example** ![img](../../../../images/strz.jpg)  
This flow retrieves filtered client data from a [GraphQL API](../graphql/graphql-request.md), converts it into a table format([Convert JSON to DataTable](../json/get-json-datareader.md)), and validates the results to ensure accurate client information was received. When the GraphQL request fails, **Throw Exception** node handles the error by displaying or logging an exception message.
