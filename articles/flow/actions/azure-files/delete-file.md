**Example** ![img](../../../../images/strz.jpg)  
The example above retrieves all file informations from a share using the [Get Share Items Info](get-share-items-info.md) action. It then iterates over each item using a [For each](../built-in/foreach.md) loop. Each file is passed to the **Delete file from a share** action.  

> [!NOTE]
> The filtering logic is implemented inside the Foreach action, allowing only the relevant files to proceed to deletion.
