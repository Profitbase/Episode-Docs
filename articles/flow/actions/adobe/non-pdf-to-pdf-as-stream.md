**Example** ![img](../../../../images/strz.jpg)  
This flow takes a documentation file (in DOCX format) from [OneDrive](../onedrive/read-file-from-onedrive-as-stream.md), sends it to the [Adobe PDF Services](https://developer.adobe.com/document-services/docs/overview/pdf-services-api/) as stream, where it is converted into a PDF format, and then [uploads](../onedrive/upload-file-to-onedrive.md) it to the selected folder in OneDrive.
