# Extract content from PDF as document tree

Extracts content from a PDF file and returns it as a tree of elements.
Use this action if you need to query the contents of a PDF document in a structured way to extract information, such as invoice details or product information. 
The action returns a [PdfTree](./apis/pdf-tree.md) that you can use in a [Function](../built-in/function.md) action to programatically read the contents of the PDF document.

The example above shows a Flow that automatically processes incoming emails with invoice attachments, extracts the invoice details, and registers them in Dynamics 365 Business Central.

## Example - Extract the Total amount from an invoice

This example shows how to extract the `Total Amount` from the sample invoice below. 
The invoice PDF file is passed in to the `Extract content from PDF as document tree` action, which returns a [PdfTree](./apis/pdf-tree.md) which is passed to a [Function](../built-in/function.md) as the  `pdfTree` parameter.  
We use the PdfTree API to get a reference to the document element with value `Total Amount`, and then navigate from there to the element containing the value. In this case, the Total Amount `value` is in the table row just below the label itself.

```csharp
// PdfTree pdfTree = ...from an "Extract content from PDF as document tree" action
var totalAmountLabel = pdfTree.FirstOrDefault(element => element.Page == 0 && element.Value == "Total Amount");
if(totalAmountLabel is null)
{
    return 0;
}

// Move up to the table row TD-> TR (Parent -> Parent), then access the second row of the TR (Children[1]) and then get the value of the object in the TD cell (Children[0].Value)
var totalAmountText = totalAmountLabel.Parent.Parent.Children[1].Children[0].Value;

// The amount is on the following format: $24.91 USD
var totalAmount = double.Parse(totalAmountText.Replace("USD", ""), NumberStyles.Currency, CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture("en-US"));
```

<br/>

## Example 2
This example shows how to extract the `Compute SUBTOTAL` from the sample invoice below.  
It first finds the table containing the invoice lines, then finds the table row containing the "Compute" row header, and then  
finds the 4th cell (.Children[3]) and picks the Value from cell object.

```csharp

// PdfTree pdfTree = ...from an "Extract content from PDF as document tree" action
var serviceDetailsTable = pdfTree.Where(element => element.ElementType == "Table" && element.Descendants().Any(c => c.Value == "SERVICE")).FirstOrDefault();

// Locate the row containing the "Compute" row header.
var computeRow = serviceDetailsTable.Descendants().Where(c => c.Value == "Compute").First().Parent.Parent;

// Pick the value of the element in the 4th (Children[3]) cell (.Children[0]). 
// Remember that the value is not stored in the cell itself, but rather in a nested child element of the cell.
var subtotalComputeText = computeRow.Children[3].Children[0].Value;

// The amount is on the following format: $24.89
var subtotalCompute = double.Parse(subtotalComputeText, NumberStyles.Currency, CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture("en-US"));
