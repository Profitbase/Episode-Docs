**Example** ![img](../../../../images/strz.jpg)  
This flow takes a  documentation file (in DOCX format) from [OneDrive](../onedrive/read-file-from-onedrive-as-byte-array.md), sends it to the [Adobe PDF Services](https://opensource.adobe.com/pdftools-sdk-docs/release/latest/index.html) as a byte array, where it is converted into a PDF format, and then [uploads](../onedrive/upload-file-to-onedrive.md) it to the selected folder in OneDrive.
