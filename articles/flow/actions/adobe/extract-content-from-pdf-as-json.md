## Output format options

**JSON_Raw**
- Contains low-level layout and styling metadata such as bounding boxes, fonts, position coordinates, justification, line height, etc.
- Best for use cases where exact PDF layout reproduction or fine-grained analysis is needed.

**JSON_Simplified**
- Extracts only plain text, organized by page.
- Suitable for basic text search and lightweight parsing.

**JSON_Hierarchical**
- Outputs a tree structure reflecting logical document structure (`Document` -> `Page` -> `heading`, `paragraph`, `table`, etc.).
- Best choice for semantically meaningful documents like theses, reports, contracts.
