#### Running Flows from the Designer

To run a Flow from the Designer, click the "Run" button in the application menu. 

If you expect the Flow to take more than 300 seconds to complete (5 minutes), you need to switch the `Development execution type` property to `Long running`, or else it will time out and terminate prematurely.
