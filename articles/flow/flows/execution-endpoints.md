# Execution endpoints

A Flow can be executed as an HTTP API, which makes it easy to integrate into custom apps or scripts.  
You can find the available API endpoints of a Flow in the `Resources -> Flow Properties` window, or you can add an [HTTP trigger](../triggers/http-trigger.md) to the Flow and get them from the `Property panel` with the trigger selected.

> [!NOTE]
> To run a Flow by its HTTP endpoint, you must configure at least one API key at the tenant level.
