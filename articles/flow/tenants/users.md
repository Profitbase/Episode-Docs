# Users

A user is someone who interacts with the Workspace and its resources. By default, only Tenant administrators have access to a Workspace. Non-admin users need to be granted access by adding them to the list of allowed users through the Workspace details screen in the Flow Portal. 

1) From the left menu, open the Workspaces panel
2) Select a Workspace and click the **Access** button
3) Select (or unselect) the user(s) that you want to grant or deny access to the Workspace
