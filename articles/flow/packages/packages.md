# What is a Flow Package ?
A Flow Package serves as a container for a collection of Flows, allowing users to bundle Flows with their dependent resources ([Workspace Objects](../workspaces/workspace-objects.md) and [Workspace Variables](../workspaces/workspace-variables.md)). The package can be exported to a file and imported into another Workspace.

## Edit

A package cannot be installed in the same Workspace where it was created.

If the selected Package was created with a older Flow version, it will automatically be upgraded to the current Flow instance version.

## Upgrade 

Upgrading a Package is done by selecting the upgrade functionality in the Installed Packages functionality and then choosing a file that contains an export of the selected Flow Package. The content of the upgrade file must contain a version property with a newer/higher version then the installed package.

## Delete 

To delete an installed package, access the delete functionality on the selected Package in the Installed Packages tab. To delete a package definition, access the delete functionality on the selected package definition in the Packages tab.
