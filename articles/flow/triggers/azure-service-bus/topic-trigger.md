# Azure Service Bus Topic trigger

 When a new message arrives in the [Azure Service Bus topic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-queues-topics-subscriptions#topics-and-subscriptions) subscription, the trigger detects it and starts the flow to process or handle the message as needed. This is useful for automating workflows that depend on incoming messages from Azure Service Bus topic.

## Example

This flow listens for messages from an Azure Service Bus topic, deserializes them into a ``MessageObject``, and stores the data in a SQL Server table. If the table or necessary columns don't exist, they are created or modified accordingly. If no message is received, the flow logs a debug message indicating that no message was found.
