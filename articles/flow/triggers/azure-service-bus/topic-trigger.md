# Azure Service Bus Topic trigger

When a new message arrives in the [Azure Service Bus topic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-queues-topics-subscriptions#topics-and-subscriptions) subscription, the trigger detects it and starts the flow to process or handle the message as needed. This is useful for automating workflows that depend on incoming messages from Azure Service Bus topic.

**Example**![img](/images/strz.jpg)   
This Flow listens for new customer-related messages published to an Azure Service Bus **topic**.  
When a message arrives, the Flow checks whether the payload contains the expected customer information.  
- If the required data exists, the customer record is inserted into the database.  
- If the data is missing, the Flow simply continues without writing to the database (in a production scenario you might also add logging or route invalid messages to a dead-letter queue).

**Example**![img](../../../../images/strz2.jpg)   
This flow listens for messages from an Azure Service Bus topic, deserializes them into a ``MessageObject``, and stores the data in a SQL Server table. If the table or necessary columns don't exist, they are created or modified accordingly. If no message is received, the flow logs a debug message indicating that no message was found.
