# InVision User Chat notification trigger

The trigger defines the starting point of a Flow that handles [User Chat](../../invision/docs/workbooks/components/userchat/user-chat.md) notifications from InVision. 

> [!NOTE]
> To use this trigger, a flow must be [created from, or added to InVision](../../invision/docs/flows/how-to/add-flow-to-solution.md). In InVision, the flow must then be attached to User Chat's [Context Item](../../invision/docs/workbooks/components/userchat/context-item.md).

**Example**![img](/images/strz.jpg)  
This flow receives a list of notifications from a [User Chat](../../invision/docs/workbooks/components/userchat/user-chat.md) in InVision. A [For each](../actions/built-in/foreach.md) action iterates over received notification items. An [Function](../actions/built-in/function.md) creates a message text from the notification item, and the [Send Message](../actions//teams/send-chat-message.md) action forwards the message to an Microsft Teams channel.
