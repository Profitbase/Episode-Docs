# Incremental Blob Trigger

Configures the Flow to automatically run by periodically checking for **new or modified blobs** in an [Azure Blob Container](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction#containers).  
This trigger is useful for automating processes that should only act on **freshly uploaded or updated files**, rather than scanning all blobs every time.

<br/>

## When to use this trigger vs. the standard Blob trigger

- Use **Incremental Blob Trigger** when:
  - You only want to process **new or modified** files since the last run.
  - You’re working with containers that hold many blobs and you want to avoid reprocessing unchanged files.
  - You need to **limit how many files** are processed per run (via *Number of blobs*).

- Use **Azure Blob Trigger** when:
  - You want to regularly **list all blobs** in a container (or within a prefix).
  - You need to process **every file**, regardless of when it was added or updated.
  - You’re setting up a one-time or recurring job that depends on scanning a whole folder.

**Example**![img](../../../../images/strz.jpg)  
This Flow listens for new or updated invoice files in Azure Blob Storage, [reads](../../actions/azure-blob-storage/read-blob-as-byte-array.md) the file contents, loads the data into a [DataTable](../../actions/sql-server/load-to-datatable.md), and finally sends a summary notification to the accounting team.

## Properties

| Name               | Type     | Description |
|--------------------|----------|-------------|
| Title              | Optional | A custom label for this trigger. This name will appear when selecting the trigger in a Flow. |
| Connection         | Required | An [Azure Blob container connection](../../actions/azure-blob-storage/azure-blob-container-connection.md). |
| Polling frequency  | Optional | Defines how often the container should be checked for new or modified blobs (e.g., every 5 minutes, hourly). |
| Number of blobs    | Optional | Limits how many new or modified blobs should be processed per polling interval. Useful for large containers or throttling. |
| Blob name          | Optional | A specific blob name to listen for. If set, the trigger will only run when this blob is updated. |
| Disabled           | Optional | Boolean value indicating whether the trigger is disabled (`true`/`false`). |
| Description        | Optional | Notes or comments about the trigger’s purpose or configuration. |

**Example**

Suppose you want to run a Flow whenever new sales reports are uploaded to the `reports` container.  
You can configure the trigger as follows:

- **Title:** `Sales reports trigger`  
- **Connection:** Connection to your Azure Blob container  
- **Polling frequency:** Every 30 minutes  
- **Number of blobs:** 10  

With this setup, the Flow will pick up **up to 10 new or updated blobs** per run, process their contents, and update your database without reprocessing older files.
