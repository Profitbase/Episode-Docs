# Azure Blob Trigger

Configures the Flow to automatically run by periodically fetching a list of all blob names in an [Azure Blob Container](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction#containers).  
This trigger is useful for automating processes that depend on new or updated files being available in a specific container.

**Example**![img](../../../../images/strz.jpg)  
This Flow monitors for updated files in Azure Blob Storage. [If](../../actions/built-in/if.md) the blob name matches UC003_Products, the file is [read](../../actions/azure-blob-storage/read-blob-as-byte-array.md) and its content is loaded into a [DataTable](../../actions/sql-server/load-to-datatable.md).

## Properties

| Name                   | Type     | Description |
|------------------------|----------|-------------|
| Title              | Optional | A custom label for this trigger. This name will appear when selecting the trigger in a Flow. |
| Connection         | Required | An [Azure Blob container connection](../../actions/azure-blob-storage/azure-blob-container-connection.md). |
| Polling frequency  | Optional | Defines how often the container should be checked for blobs (e.g., every 5 minutes, hourly). |
| Blob name prefix filter | Optional | Limits the trigger to only run for blobs with names starting with the specified prefix. |
| Blob name          | Optional | A specific blob name to listen for. If set, the trigger will only run when this blob is present. |

**Example**

Suppose you want to run a Flow every time new invoice files are uploaded to the `invoices` container.  
You can configure the trigger as follows:

- **Title:** `Invoices trigger`  
- **Connection:** Connection to your Azure Blob container  
- **Polling frequency:** Every 60 minutes  
- **Blob name prefix filter:** `invoices/`  

Whenever a new blob with a name starting with `invoices/` is found, the Flow will automatically start, enabling you to process the file contents (e.g., extract data and save it to a Profitbase Data Store).
