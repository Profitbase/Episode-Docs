# Azure Event Hub trigger

When a new message arrives in the Azure Event hub, the trigger detects it and starts the flow to process or handle the message as needed. This is useful for automating workflows that depend on incoming messages from [Azure Event hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-features).

This Flow listens for invoice messages arriving in an Event Hub.  
If the message contains invoice data, itâ€™s added to a database; otherwise the Flow throws a controlled exception.
