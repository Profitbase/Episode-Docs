# SaaS and on-premises workloads

Profitbase Flow runs on Microsoft Azure as a fully managed Software-as-a-Service offering.
You can also run Flow on your own Virual Machines or servers, making it possible for organizations with strict regulatory and compliance requirements to utilize the offering.

## Profitbase Flow in Azure / AKS

Profitbase Flow SaaS runs on Microsoft Azure and Azure Kubernestes Services. User logon to the service is managed through Microsoft Entra ID, which provides a single-sign-on experience to users using their existing Entra ID accounts.

<br/>

## On-premises / Virtual machines (self-hosting)

If you need to host Profitbase Flow in your own data center, on-premises or in a public cloud virtual machine, this option is fully supported.
You will need to run Profitbase Flow on a Windows Server with IIS web server and Windows Services, using SQL Server (or Azure SQL) as storage.
