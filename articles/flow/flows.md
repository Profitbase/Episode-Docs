#### Flows

You define all business logic in a Flow by combining triggers and actions into a sequence of operations using a drag-and-drop interface.

To run a Flow, you have several options including  

- Run a Flow from the Designer.
- Run a Flow by making a standard HTTP request.
- Define triggers to run a Flow as a response to an event in an external system
- Run a Flow on a schedule or recurring basis.
