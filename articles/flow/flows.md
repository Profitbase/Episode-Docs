#### Flows

You define all business logic in a Flow by combining triggers and actions into a sequence of operations using a drag-and-drop interface.

To run a Flow, you have several options including  

- [Run a Flow from the Designer](flows/running-flows/from-designer.md).
- [Run a Flow by making a standard HTTP request](flows/running-flows/from-third-party-app.md).
- [Define triggers to run a Flow as a response to an event in an external system](flows/running-flows/from-events-in-external-systems.md)
- [Run a Flow on a schedule or recurring basis](flows/running-flows/run-scheduled.md)
- [Run a Flow within another Flow](flows/running-flows/nested-execution.md)
