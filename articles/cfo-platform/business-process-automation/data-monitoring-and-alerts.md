# Track events and data, and raise alerts when action is needed

Using [Profitbase Flow](../../flow/flow.md) and [Profitbase InVision](../../invision/invision.md), organizations can help the right people make informed decisions swiftly and accurately, using continuously updated information from both internal and external data sources.

This is accomplished through live integrations with APIs, services, and databases, which provide data to business rules engines for analysis. The engine processes the information, updates target systems and reports, and notifies the right people, enabling them to take timely and appropriate action.

[Profitbase Flow](../../flow/flow.md) lets you build data integrations and business rules engines, while [Profitbase InVision](../../invision/invision.md) is used for building user interfaces and data models. Profitbase Flow and InVision are fully integrated, and offers a seamless experience for building business process automation solutions.
