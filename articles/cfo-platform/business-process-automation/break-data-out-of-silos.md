# Break data out of silos using automatic dataflows and integrations

Profitbase Flow offers extensive support for connectors and data adapters across various systems, including databases, ERP systems, email, Collaboration tools, Cloud Storage, files and many more

As data is updated in disparate systems by users or applications, Profitbase Flow ensures robust and reliable synchronization of information across the organization.

This is achieved by building Flows that:

1) Connect to one or more source systems to extract data.
2) Apply business logic, such as transformations, calculations, filtering, enrichments, and validations.
3) Connect to one or more target systems to update data.
