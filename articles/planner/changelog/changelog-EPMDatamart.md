- Data Import and Export uses Flow instead of Dataflows and Azure Functions.
- New and improved Column Mapping popup for import.
- File splitting is now set with maximum rows instead of file size.
- Migration from Eaze to JavaScript started.
- Data Import & Export support .parquet file type. 

## EPM Datamart 5.5.0

**Changes:**

- New workbook "System Configuration": (#1580)
  - Configure which database objects to expose to the data import and export modules.
  - Option to give friendly names and descriptions to each object.
  - Configure Instance settings in UI for Datamart and Common (previously done by running scripts in designer)
  - Azure Function URLs visible and editable in UI.
  - New import option can be configured per import object: "Incremental File Reload", enables a secondary file prefix to specify periods to import based on file name patterns YYYY or YYYYMM. (#1690)
- Data Export: new option to create multiple files, by specifying a maximum file size. If exceeded, multiple files will be created. Each file will have a suffix [FileName]_[file number].csv (#1617)
- Data Import: new options for "custom" merge method. Enables abort copying data from temporary table to final destination if row count decreases or is 0 (#1655)
- Data Import: Warn user when changing fields that trigger autosave. A (modal) confirm box implemented when changing destination for import or connection. (#1689)
- Currency Exchange Rates Monthly Override decimals - Changed format to 5 decimals. (#1662)
- Azure Functions upgraded with newest packages and upgraded .NET framework to 8.0. Greatly improves performance and stability. (#1707)

## EPM Datamart 5.4.0

**Changes:**

- New Config setting to set Azure Hosted or on Premise (#1621)
- Data Import - Temp Table Name read-only. (#1600)
  - Reduces the chance of error by multiple rulesets using the same temp table (may arise from copying a ruleset, or user input using a common word such as "ledger").
  - Guarantees that it is unique per ruleset.
  - Makes maintenance and clean up easier (clean up improved in 5.4.0).
  - One field less for the user to worry about.
  - Still readable if user needs it for debug purposes.
- Data Import Destinations dropdown sorting updated to show most relevant tables first.
- Data Import form disabled while saving / loading to prevent input while saving (#1445)

**Enhancement:**

- A new target "FINANCE_ACTUAL" has been created to make it easier and more efficient to import finance actual data (#1624).

Data is imported as a slice of data for some or all legal entities and some or all fiscal periods.
This will make it faster to do incremental data loading by:

- Replace imported fiscal periods where imported fiscal periods determined by filter on source or CSV file(s) content.
- Replace imported or all legal entity fiscal periods loaded
- From Operations this load is now compleded in one step (where pbTransdataActual and ReportAccountByMonthActual is updated in same operation).

This require customers to ensure that finance actual data is not loaded to both pbTransdataHistory and FINANCE_ACTUAL (table pbTransdataActual).

Note that a new mandatory column, FiscalPeriod, must be mapped for this to work.

- Data Import (Azure) greatly increased performance.
- Data Import - Azure method - Add support for more complex SQL expressions. Was previously limited to simple "Linq" expressions. Now supports more advanced SQL. (#1412)
- Data Import - File Cleaning option (#1620)
  - File Cleaning is now an option you can set per ruleset. If on, the source files will be overwritten by a cleaning routine.
  - This removes some ASCII symbols, whitespace at end of file, etc..
  - Deprecates this issue: #1575
- Add custom File Import Destinations (#1608)
- Add Operation Launcher in Data Import / Export. It is now possible to configure Operations to be launchable from Data Import / Export.
- Data Import improved auto cast for import of empty values into numeric fields.
- Data Import Column Mapping (AutoCast) - Replace decimal separators (space or apostrophe) from csv with nothing for numeric fields. (#1572)

  (Reduce further errors converting nvarchar to numeric problems)
- Data Import Auto Cast for column mapping improved to better handle decimals (#1587)
  - Simpler formula that will handle more scenarios, whether using SQL import or CSV import.

    And will help seeing less of the annoying "Error converting data type varchar to numeric. "
- Data Import Column mapping - More space for SQL formulas (#1586)
- Data Export performance increased. (Automatically fetches WorkProcessVersionID when ExportName is specified.)
- Optimize and enable finance actual data import and enable for reporting (#1597)

**Bug fixes:**

- Data Import run as operation ignores "Auto Archive" setting (#1619)
- Excel Export in DataMart Export (restored) (#1609)
- Timeout increased for Import jobs run from operations (#1583)
- Incorrect last modified date shown for destination in Data Import. (#1584)
- Currency exchange rates - not generated after 2028 (#1565)
- File Import of empty values into numeric fields now properly handled.
