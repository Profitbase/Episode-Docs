## Abstract, intended audience and pre-requisites

## Modules
Planner modules are operational input modules that contributors to the work processes use to prepare the Profit & Loss (P&L) of their respective areas of responsibility. Different modules will typically cover parts of the P&L such as sales, personnel, cost, etc.
