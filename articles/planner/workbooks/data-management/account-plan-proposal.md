## Overview
In some cases it may be desirable to pre-fill an input module with a proposal so that the contributors can have a qualified starting point for their work. As such, a plan proposal will normally be made in a new version prior to the users starting the detailed planning. Such a proposal can be created for the account input module using the Account plan proposal workbook.

The process of defining such a proposal contains of two steps:

1. Create basis proposal - define the and adjust the data source(s) that will constitute the proposal.
2. Create the basis proposal and further refine it before importing it into the input module.
