## Overview
Report setup is used to define new reports by defining report lines that aggregates a set of accounts and subtotals with styling such as underline and bold text.

The reports set up here will be selectable under Finance Reports.

The report with ID "INPUT" is (by default) for grouping accounts for input in distributed input. For all practical purposes this report will be a variant of a profit and loss report. The starting point for defining the INPUT report should be your Profit & Loss report. From here you may want to modify to adjust resolution for account grouping to be better suited for input by e.g. increasing number of report lines for income and expenses.
