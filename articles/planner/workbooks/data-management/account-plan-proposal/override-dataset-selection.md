# Override dataset mapping
## Overview

If the default source dataset mapping done on the main page does not cover the mapping needs for all cases, this detailed map can be used to pin point specific mappings for specific parts of the organization.

Make sure to make a selection in the organizational dimension filter, as the detailed map will otherwise not display.

For each department and plan month, the source department, from (source) date or source dataset can be set.

Make changes as appropriate, and click the Save button.

Note that any rows explicitly set will be marked as overridden in the Ovr column to make it easier to keep track of the changes made. A comment field is also provided so that any specific considerations can be expressed and saved.

If, after overrides are done, the main (default) map on the main page is changed, you are given the choice of keeping the overrides made here or discard them.
