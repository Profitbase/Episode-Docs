# Import proposal
## Overview

This is where the import of the proposal is done. 

Note that the import is sensitive to the selection made in the organizational filter. By selecting a specific (lowest) level node, the import can be done for the node in question. Otherwise (no selection is made in the organizational filter, or a higher level selection is made), the import will affect the complete organization.
