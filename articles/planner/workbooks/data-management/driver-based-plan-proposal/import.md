# Import proposal
## Overview

This is where the import of the proposal is done. 

Note that the import is sensitive to the selection made in the organizational filter. By selecting a specific (lowest) level node, the import can be done for the node in question. Otherwise (no selection is made in the organizational filter, or a higher level selection is made), the import will affect the complete organization.

**Applies to:** ![img](https://profitbasedocs.blob.core.windows.net/icons/yes-icon.png) Planner 6.1 or later<br/>

New import options:

- Keep distribution: keep the distribution in the proposal (default = checked) or not (i.e. central distribution keys will take effect)
- Process data: process data after plan proposal is imported (default = checked) or not.
