If the proposal is as desired, it can be imported straight away using the Import... button. Please refer to [Import...](import.md)

The basis proposal can be adjusted clicking the "Adjust data and periods" button, please refer to [Adjust data and periods](adjust-data-and-periods.md)

If, having exhausted the adjustment options available, the proposal is still not as desired you may have to revert to [1. Create basis proposal](create-basis-proposal.md) in order to rethink the source dataset mapping and to create a revised basis proposal.
