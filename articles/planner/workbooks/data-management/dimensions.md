## Overview
This is the workbook for maintaining dimensional data.  Profitbase EPM makes use of a primary dimension concept for central dimension management. Primary dimensions can be published to versioned copies of the dimensions, for example a copy residing with a Planner version.

Note that in most solutions, some of the dimensions (typically legal entity, department and account) are sourced from external sources and may not be maintained locally in Planner.
