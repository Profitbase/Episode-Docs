**Calendar from-to**
Defines the from-to dates between which currency exchange rates are processed. Please take into account that the from-to should include both historical and future rates.

**Dataset**
Defines basic datasets for reporting, such as Actual and Budget. These datasets are pre-defined by Planner and no new datasets can be added nor existing deleted. The names, however, can be edited.

The datasets are used for reporting [Finance reports](../../financial-planning/finance-reports.md) and will be combined with the different plan versions that are made available for reporting.
