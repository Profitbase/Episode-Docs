## Overview

This is where the workday calendar - that is an indication of which dates are workdays and which dates are not - is maintained. The years available are controlled by the setting of the "Calendar from-to" in the adjoining Setup page.

<br/>

This information is used when assigning process tasks [Processes](../../process-and-tasks/process-and-schedule-manager/processes.md) if the process in question is set up to calculate lead days based on a working day calendar as apposed to a normal 7-days-per-week calendar.

This allows automated deadlines (due dates) of process tasks that are based on recurring events +- lead/lag days to skip non workdays.
Each process can be configured whether to take this calendar into account or not on the [processes](../../process-and-tasks/process-and-schedule-manager/processes.md) page.
