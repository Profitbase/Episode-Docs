## Category Setup

Manage the categories used by the operations. The categories are used to filter the operation list and find an operation faster.

The checkbox for "Visible" allows you to hide categories without deleting any operations.

Some categories may be needed by the Planner modules, and cannot be renamed, such a "Data Import".

Click the "Add" button to add a category.

Click the "Save" button to save the category names. This button only activates when names have been changed.

Click on the arrow icons to re-order the categories.

Click on the trash icon to delete a category.

Categories should have one name for English and one for Norwegian.
