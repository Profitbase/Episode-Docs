The dimensions are shared between models. If a dimension drop-down list of a certain model should not display a certain member, it can be excluded for that model adding it to the list of excluded dimension members. Add new rows, by hovering the mouse over the data area, perform a mouse right-click and select one of the "Insert new row.." options. <br/>

Add dimension members to excluded and click the “Save” button.<br/>
Click "Close" to close the dialogue.
