## Overview
This page allows you to define a calculation tied to a model measure.
<br/>

There are two types of calculations:<br/>

-	Cell-calculations: simple arithmetic calculations (+ - * /) between measures of a model. These calculations are performed automatically, as-you-type, when editing data in the input model.<br/>

Note that when defining the cell-calculation formula, the measures are defined by the measure id enclosed in square brackets, for example [SalesQty] * [SalesUnitPrice].<br/>

-	Button-click calculations: more complex calculations involving for example conditionals. Such calculations are defined as SQL statements and will not calculate automatically, as-you-type, when editing data in the input model. These calculations will require the click of a button to execute, specifically the “Recalculate” button.<br/>

In the calculation dialogue, one can also enter more elaborate descriptions using the “Calculation description” fields.<br/>

Click "Save" to save any changes made.<br/>
Click "Close" to close the dialogue.
