## Overview

If the email reported by Azure/Active Directory is wrong, you can override this field here.

1. Click "Add user", this will show a popup where you can find a user to add to the override list.
2. Once the user has been added to the list, provide an "Override Email" in the appropriate field.
3. Click "Save".

<br/>

This email will now be used instead of the one provided by Active Directory, in, for example, the [tasks](/planner/workbooks/process-and-tasks/tasks) module.

<br/>

To remove a user from this list, click the delete icon, and the system will go back to using the Active Directory email. 
<br/>
(Adding or removing a user from this list will not affect his access or permissions in any way)
