# User management
## Overview

Access to resources, such as Workbooks, Data, and APIs are granted to User Groups. User Groups contain (user or group) accounts from Windows or Microsoft Entra ID.

You can add or import your users.

When you "add" users, you connect to the identity provider that the system is set up to use (for example Windows or Azure Active Directory).
