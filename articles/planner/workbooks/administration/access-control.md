## Overview
Basic User Level Access means access rights that allow the user to read, change or delete information which she or he owns or data and objects shared with the user or the user’s group.

Generally, basic user level access affords the least amount of authority and permissions regarding an organization’s network. Basic user level access stands in contrast to higher levels of access rights.
