1. **The budget summary report** <br/>
A Profit and Loss summary report that displays the budget done so far. It contains a set of profit and loss report lines (rows) that either sums a range of accounts or act as a calculation of other report lines. The profit and loss setup will vary from solution to solution. 
2. **Periods button** <br/>
The Periods button enables you to toggle between a year-total view and a periodic view of the budget. The budget covers a 12-month period. 
3. **Trend** <br/>
The Trend button takes you in to the Trend pop up page in which it is possible to trend the development of various report lines over time. It will vary from solution to solution which report lines are enabled for trending.
4. **Workflow** <br/>
The workflow enables you to set the state of the budget. The state set will be propagated to the input modules associated with the solution for the department currently selected. Setting the state to Finished will by default disable any further input to the input modules (depends on user's access level).
5. **Go to input module** <br/>
Launch drop down selector for launching specific input modules. When selecting an input module from the drop down, the input module will launch and replace the Summary.
