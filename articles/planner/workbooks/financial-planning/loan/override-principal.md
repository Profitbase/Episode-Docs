## Overview

For term (serial) loans, the principals are by default generated automatically by the system. If you are required to override the default principals, this can be done by adding rows to this page. You add rows by hovering the mouse over the data area, perform a mouse right-click and select one of the "Insert new row.." options.<br/>

Click "Apply ovr" to apply any overrides.<br/>
Click "Remove ovr" to remove all overrides added for the current loan.<br/>
Click "Cancel" to cancel any changes made.

## Column Descriptions

Note that the heading of the columns and their visibility can be configured and may thus differ from the example.<br/>

- **One-off:**<br/>
If this is a one-off principal, check the One-off check box. If this is a change that will last for multiple rollovers, leave the One-off check box unchecked (mandatory).<br/>
Note that if this is a one-off principal, a new override row should be added thereafter to resume the default principal.<br/>
- **Date/From date**<br/>
Depending on the One-off setting, specify the principal date (One-off checked) or specify the date from which the new principal should take effect (One-off unchecked) (mandatory). The adjustment will take effect on the following rollover.<br/>
- **Amount:**<br/>
The new principal amount (mandatory).<br/>
