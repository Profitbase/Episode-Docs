## Overview

Planner is by nature versioned, i.e. plan data exists for multiple versions. In a monthly rolling forecast context, a new version will be created each month.

Export names are tags that logically attach a planner version to an external dataset tag (the export name). For example an export name Current forecast may be created and attached to the Planner version that represents the current forecast at any one time. The export name is used as a filter when exporting data. Note that only one version can hold a given export names at any one time.

This page is used to create the different export names (right-click in the input grid to reveal menu options such as Insert new row).
