## Overview
Profitbase Planner provides a Web interface organized in Workbooks that are grouped as listed below. This is the same grouping that will appear in the menu in every workbook. See the example in the picture below.

Users with access restrictions will not have access to the full set of workbooks and hence the menu in your workbooks may only show a subset.
