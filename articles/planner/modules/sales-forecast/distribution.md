### Overview
Measures that allow input may have a central (default) distribution key associated with them, one that distributes any year-total input to the periods corresponding to the year. This page displays the distribution key (if any) associated with the measure and its effective distribution, i.e. the distribution actually in use. Even though a central distribution key exists, the user may override the distribution by inputting periodic values directly in which case the periodic values will be the effective distribution key.<br/>
The fallback to a central key is an even distribution.<br/>
