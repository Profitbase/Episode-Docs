## Overview
This is the the Sales forecast input module and is where any detailed forecasting of sales per product and market (and possibly other dimensions) takes place.<br/>

The sales forecast module uses a driver-based principle.<br/>

Multiple models consisting of measures may be defined. Common to all models is the definition of one of the measures as the driving measure for that model. In the example below, a model for Product Sales is used.<br/>

Examples of driving measures may be Sales quantity, Sales volume, FTE (Full Time Equivalents) and so on.<br/>

The module consists of a main driver view in which the driver can bet adjusted and a detailed view in which the complete model can be viewed and adjusted.<br/>
