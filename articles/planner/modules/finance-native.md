### Overview
This is the Finance advanced input module. It allows input directly on the native financial engine sources Sales, Purchase, Payroll and Expense. The module may be used in cases where other, operationalized modules can not be used or for gaining a better understanding of the financial engines themselves and the transactions they produce.<br/>

A major difference compared to ther modules, is the transactional nature of the input, each input specifies the transaction date.<br/>

Each financial engine has it's own set of columns broadly divided into:

- Basic columns such as transaction date, amount and quantity (qty) and currency.<br/>
- Dimensional context such as Legal entity, department, account and so on.<br/>
- A set of of engine-specific override columns. Each engine consumes financial settings as defined in the Finance settings workbook. However, most of these settings can be overrriden on specific input transactions fed to the engines, the source transactions which is the input format in this module.<br/>

Multiple input models can be set up in the Setup page in which a selection of engines, their dimensions and override columns can be set.<br/>

Models that are published contribute to the plan while data from unpublished models is ignored.<br/>
