## Overview
Measures that allow input may have a central (default) distribution key associated with them, one that distributes any year-total input to the periods corresponding to the year. This page displays the distribution key (if any) associated with the measure and its effective distribution, i.e. the distribution actually in use. Even though a central distribution key exists, the user may override the distribution by inputting periodic values directly in which case the periodic values will be the effective distribution key.<br/>
The fallback to a central key is an even distribution.<br/>

If periodic values are set specifically and you would like to revert to the default key, click the "Use default" button.<br/>
To close, click "Close".<br/>

**Applies to:** ![img](https://profitbasedocs.blob.core.windows.net/icons/yes-icon.png) Planner 5.5.0 or later

The effective distribution key values grid is editable and allows you to define an override key using percentages. Percentages sum to 100% as a starting total and will change as individual periods' % is changed. This gives the opportunity to change multiple periods while keeping an eye on the total summing to 100%. However, the total does not have to sum to 100% although that may be the most intuitive for a user.  <br/>

To alter the key, edit the Effective values grid. This highlights the Redistribute button and allows you to alter the distribution. Note that this will not change the total, merely redistribute it.  <br/>

The distribution dialogues is accessible from both the driver page and the detail page.  <br/>
