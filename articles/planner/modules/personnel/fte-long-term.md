## Overview
For long-term (beyond next year) forecasting, the level of detail is less â€“ input is done for the department as a whole:<br/>
- FTE for given year<br/>
- Expected annual salary raise for given year<br/>
The detailed forecast for next year is used as a basis for scaling the long-term forecast based on the change in FTE and annual salary raise. The periodic distribution for next year is replicated for the long-term forecast.<br/>
