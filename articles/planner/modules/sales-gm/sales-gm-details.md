This button is active when the module is launched from the Budget or Forecast summary workbook. Clicking the Back button will launch the summary workbook in the same browser window. If there are unsaved changes made in the Sales by GM% module, a prompt will appear requesting confirmation.
2. **Periods button** <br/>
The Periods button toggles the input mode between a year-total input and a periodic input. Any year-total input will automatically be distributed to the periods. Input made to periods will automatically be summed to the year-total.

The GM% column contains a "Change" link that takes you to a pop-up window in which you can override the GM% per period. 
4. **Workflow** <br/>
The workflow enables you to set the state of the plan for the department selected. Setting the state to Finished will by default disable any further input (depends on user's access level).
