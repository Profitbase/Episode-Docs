## Overview
The success of most rolling Forecast solutions is largely dependent on how easy and efficient is it for the casual user to provide input. Planner, therefore, offers a rich set of Modules to make it convenient for users to provide input on:

- [Input on Account](modules/account) - traditional and easy but not necessarily easy for non-finance users.
- [Payroll input](modules/personnel) - allow for input on employee or employee category and headcount and percent of full-time. Here you can input additional costs for benefits.
- [CapEx](/planner/workbooks/financial-planning/capex) - plan for investments.
- [Loan](/planner/workbooks/financial-planning/loan) - plan for loans including ongoing loans.

**Applies to:** ![img](https://profitbasedocs.blob.core.windows.net/icons/yes-icon.png) Planner 5.3 or later

- [Finance advanced input](modules/finance-native) - advanced input on native financial engine sources. Here you can create input models operating directly on the native financial engine sources for Sales, Purchase, Payroll and/or Expense. This can be useful in cases where more oerationalized modules can not be used or for gaining a better understanding of the financial engines and the transactions they produce.

**Applies to:** ![img](https://profitbasedocs.blob.core.windows.net/icons/yes-icon.png) Planner 5 or later

- [Driver based](modules/driver-based) - driver-based planning. Here you can model to drive a set of income and cost inputs from one single input (e.g. quantity sold).

**Applies to:** ![img](https://profitbasedocs.blob.core.windows.net/icons/yes-icon.png) Planner 4.x

- [Sales Forecast](modules/sales-forecast) - driver-based forecast input. Here you can model to drive a set of income and cost inputs from one single input (e.g. quantity sold).
- [Sales Gross Margin budget input](modules/sales-gm) - allow to input sales and gross margin for the budget.

Input modules are optional and configurable to be able to cover most cases from simple on-account input to complex driver-based planning.
