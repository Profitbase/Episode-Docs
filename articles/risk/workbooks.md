# Workbooks

## Overview
Profitbase Risk provides a Web interface organized in Workbooks grouped as listed below. It is the same grouping that will appear in the menu in every workbook.

<br/>

Users with access restrictions will not have access to the full set of workbooks, and hence the menu in your workbooks may only show a subset.

<br/>

The full set of workbook groups and workbooks are:

<br/>
