## Overview

This is the workbook where the Risk Submission status is managed.

<br/>

## The risk submission process

A risk owner sets a risk as “Reviewed” in the "Risks" workbook. The risk then appears in this workbook, ready to be evaluated by a risk manager at the next level in the organizational hierarchy. The risk can be approved for submission to the group level, or sent back down for further elaboration and preparation at the previous organizational level.

<br/>

In order to manage risk development over time; this risk review process can follow a pre-established (or ad-hoc) pattern, for example, a quarterly risk review. When starting a new risk review process, all previously submitted risks are sent back to the risk owners at various levels in the organization for review. When risks are in review, risk owners are required to re-evaluate their previous risk assessments.

For more information on how to start a new risk review process, please see [Risk Administration ](/risk/workbooks/risk-admin.md).
