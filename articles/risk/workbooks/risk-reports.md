## Overview

This is the main workbook for reports, such as risk levels over time.

<br/>

## Risk version diagram

This diagram tracks how the risks at a departmental level develop over time by using data from the different submitted versions.

- Choose filters on the left-hand side of the screen to fit the department, categories etc., that you want in your report (1)
- Select "From version" and "To Version". This defines which time periods/versions the report contains (2)
- Select the risks you want to highlight using the checkboxes next to the risk (3)
- Turn "Category Average" on and off to see how a category as a whole has developed over time. This relies on average calculations of the risk levels in the underlying categories. (4)

## Risk Effect Chart

This chart lets you combine the likelihood, impacts and financial impacts of various risk in a risk matrix. The coordinates of a risk is dependent on its likelihood and consequence scores. The size of the risk bubbles reflect the "estimated risk effect" e.g. the monetary value given a risk. A large bubble implies a high monetary value. The size of the bubbles can be adjusted by a system administrator, please see [Risk Administration](risks/risk-admin.md).

- Select "Version" This defines which time period/version the report contains (2)
- Select the risks you want to highlight using the checkboxes next to the risk (3)
- Turn "Category Average" on and off to see how a category as a whole is valued. This relies on average calculations of the risk levels and monetary risk effects in the underlying categories. (4)
- By hovering over a risk, more information is visible. The risk is also highlighted in the risk list in the middle of the screen.
