Example 20 > 10 returns true. 10 > 20 returns false. >= Greater than or equal. Checks if the value on the left side is greater than, or equal to the value on the right side. < Less than operator. Checks if the value on the left side is less than the value on the right side. Example 20 < 10 returns false. 10 < 20 returns true. <= Less than or equal operator. Checks if the value on the left side is less than, or equal to the value on the right side. == Equals operator. Checks if the value on the left side is equal to the value on the right side. Example 1 == 1 returns true. 1 == 2 returns false. != Not equals operator. Checks if the value on the left side does not equal the value on the right side. Example 1 != 1 returns false. 1 != 2 returns true. Logical operators Operator Description && Conditional AND operator. Performs a logical AND of its left and right operands. The right operand is only evaluated if the left operand is true. || Conditional OR operator. Performs a logical OR of its left and right operands. The right operand is only evaluated if the left operand is false. Arithmetic operators Operator Description + Binary operator + for numeric types sums the operands. Binary operator + also concatenates strings if one of the operands is a string. You can also use the CONCAT function to concatenate strings. Example 1 + 2 returns 3. - Binary operator ‚Äì subtract the second operand from the first. Example 2 ‚Äì 1 returns 1 * The multiplication operator computes the product of its operands. Example 2 * 2 returns 4 / The division operator divides its first operand by its second operand Example 2 / 2 returns 1. % The modulus operator computes the remainder after dividing its first operand by its second operand. Example 10 % 2 returns 0 Primary Operators Operator Description . (x.y) Member access. Example \"xyx\".substring(‚Ä¶) X?.y Null conditional member access. Returns null if the left hand operand is null.

(!x) Logical negation Example X = !true; (X becomes false) Other binary operators Operator Description ?? Null coalescing operator. The ?? operator checks whether the value provided on the left side of the expression is null, and if so it returns an alternate value indicated by the right side of the expression. If the value provided on the left side of the expression isn't null, then it returns the original value Example: null ?? \"Hello\" returns the string Hello. 0 ?? \"Hello\" returns 0"

If you want all values in the column to use the same format string, you will typically just set the format string in the Column styles formatting pane. However, if you want to apply different format strings to cells in a column based on which row they are on, you can use the Format() function in a column calculation to conditionally apply different format strings to the cells in the column. Example This example shows how to apply a custom format string to specific cells in a column using the Format function. In particular, we want to apply a custom format string to the cells of the Sales and Accounts Receivables lines. Go to Edit mode Right-click the column header that you want to apply custom formatting to, then choose \"Add column formula\" In the Formula editor, enter the following formula: IF(RowHeader() == \"Sales\" || RowHeader() == \"Accounts Receivables\", Format([Column], \"#,#.00\"), [Column]) You get the [Column] token ([Jan] in this example) into the formula at the current caret position by clicking a cell in the column.

    "keywords": "#Premium feature The primary use case for the Hide empty rows feature is when you add custom subtotal rows before or after rows that may be empty in the Power BI data model for different filter contexts. For example, Account X may be empty for Department A, but not for Department B. You usually don't want to show empty rows, so the default setting for the \"Show items with no data\" option for a field in the Rows bucket is \"false\". If you add a custom subtotal row relative to a row that is filtered out, the custom subtotal row will disappear because its anchor row does not exist in the data set coming from Power BI. To work around this issue, you can turn on \"Show items with no data\" for the field(s) in the Rows bucket so they are loaded from the data model, and then enable the Hide empty rows feature in the visual. This will hide the rows from the data model that is empty, but custom subtotal rows added relative to them will still appear. Always show custom rows Toggle this option off to hide custom rows that are empty. Always show JSON rows Toggle this option off to hide rows defined using the JSON row format that are empty. The JSON row format is usually used for specifying a fixed report format, so that for example a P&L always contains a fixed set of items regardless of whether they are empty or not. Condition Use this field to specify a custom condition for hiding empty rows. For example, the following condition will hide an empty row if its row header is \"Sales\". RowHeader() == \"Sales\" Another example is if you always want empty rows to be visible on the root level, but hide them on any sub levels. You can use the RowLevel() function for this purpose. RowLevel() >= 1 You can also combine multiple condition using the logical operands &&, ||. The following condition will hide empty rows if the row header equals \"Sales\" and the row is at level 1 or greater. (Row levels are 0-indexed, so rows at the root level are at level 0) RowHeader() == \"Sales\" && RowLevel() >= 1"

To fake ragged hierarchies, columns representing intermediate levels in dimensions tables are are usually padded with blanks or the value of the \"parent column\" is copied to the intermediate column. The effect of this when using a ragged hierarchy in a report, is that when you expand a row, the value of the expanded level is either blank or it matches the parent. This forces the user to expand multiple levels with the seemingly exact same value all the way to the lowest level. If you have a ragged hierarchy, you can enable the appropriate option (based on which padding technique you are using) to automatically hide intermediate (padded) levels from the user. For example, if the user expands the root level and level 1-3 are padded, we will automatically expand to level 4 and hide the intermediate levels.

Financial data is highly sensitive information, and we are committed to protecting your data from any unwanted or unauthorized access. 1. Certified by Microsoft The Financial Reporting Matrix is certified by Microsoft. This means that the visual is tested by Microsoft to verify that it doesn't access external services or resources, and that it follow secure coding patterns and guidelines. 2. Hosting model and data The image below describes how the Visual is hosted and isolated in Power BI, and how data is ingested and managed by the Visual. Financial Reporting Matrix is a Power BI custom visual. Each custom visual run in an isolate sandbox within a Power BI report page, called an iFrame. All data available to the visual is pushed from the Power BI model and query engine TO the visual. The visual does not fetch any data on its own. 3. Hosting model and isolation The Visual does not in any way access data or any other type of information outside of the Visual itself, including its hosting environment. Each Power BI custom visual is hosted in a dedicated iFrame, meaning it is totally isolated and cannot interact with any outside Power BI feature or function without going through the official Power BI custom visuals API provided by Microsoft. A custom visual can not directly interact with other visuals, neither built-in nor other custom visuals. This means that the Visual cannot and will not try to access any type of information or data from other visuals or from the Power BI environment. 4. Networking and data traffic The Visual does not make or receive any network calls, and does not share any type of data externally, neither user information nor business data. 1. Incoming Data All business data used by, and available to the Visual for building and displaying reports come from the Power BI Data Model and is provided to the Visual by the Power BI query engine using a push model, meaning data is always pushed by the Power BI runtime into the Visual. The Visual does not, and cannot, initiate network calls or requests to access the Data Model. Also, the visual does not make any network calls to request or send data to any other resource. The only exception to this rule is that the Visual can request more data from the same Data Model query when the result of a query exceeds the maximum amount of data Power BI will push to the Visual in one chunk. In this case, the Visual can request to get the next chunk of data until everything has been received. 2. Local Storage The Visual does not use the browser localStorage or Power BI Storage API to store or retrieve data in any way. 3. Exporting data from the visual The only way to export data from the Visual is by direct user interaction through the Power BI user interface or using screen capture technology. The Visual itself does not have a data export API or feature of any kind. 5. Technology and 3rd party libraries This Visual is build using React.js, which is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. In addition to React.js, we also use a few other industry standard open-source libraries for specific features in the app. 3rd party libraries used by the Visual The following 3rd party is used by the Visual. We monitor new releases and security vulnerability reports of these libraries, and keep them up to date to ensure our Visual does expose security vulnerabilities. antd v4.15.5 classnames v2.3.1 core-js v3.12.1 immutable v4.0.0-rc-12 lodash.clonedeep v4.5.0 moment v2.29.1 react v17.0.2 react-dom v17.0.2 react-color v2.19.3 react-contexify v5.0.0 react-error-boundary v3.1.3 react-resize-detector v6.7.1 react-select v4.3.1 react-table v7.0.4 slate v0.47.9 slate-react v0.22.10 styled-components v5.3.0 tweetnacl v1.0.3 tweetnacl-util v 0.15.1 underscore v1.13.1 Questions?

In a large data set, bad values may constitute a small amount of data, making them hard to track down. By enabling Error handling behaviors in the Data import options, you can record the bad data encountered during a CSV import and investigate which rows and fields prevent a successful import. Bad data is stored in the BadData collection of a CSV DataReader or CSV DataTable, and can be read as an IEnumerable<BadDataRecord> or as an IDataReader. This makes it easy to dump the information to a database table or a file for review. The BadDataRecord has the following properties: Name Data type Description RecordIndex Int32 The index of the record / row in the CSV data set. RecordData String The raw record / row in the CSV data set. DebugInfo String Descriptive information about what caused the data to fail validation. Example To dump bad data to a SQL Server table, do the following: Create a table with the following schema (You can name it whatever you like).

For example, the DepartmentID from the input is copied to the DepartmentID in the output / target.

    "keywords": "Actions and Triggers The business logic of a Flow is defined by combining triggers and actions into a \"program\" that runs from start to finish. To define the execution path of a Flow, connect the Execution In and Execution Out ports of actions in the desired order. Data and conditions may determine which path the Flow executes to complete its task. There are a few simple rules that apply to how actions and triggers can be used in a Flow: A Flow can have zero or one trigger. In cases where you want to trigger a Flow based on events from multiple systems, use the MultiTrigger. A Flow can have any number of actions. A Flow cannot have multiple entry points. An entry point is defined as an action or trigger with no inbound connections. If you add multiple entry points, Flow will execute the path with the longest chain of actions. All other actions will be ignored. A trigger does not have parameters, but it can return an output. (All triggers except the Schedule trigger have some type of output) Actions can have parameters and return zero or one result. Some actions, such as the If-Else block and Foreach loop have multiple execution sub paths. Inputs and outputs Actions can have parameters (inputs) and return a value (output). An action and a trigger can only have a single output, but an output can be a collection of items, a complex business object or a simple scalar value like a number. In Flow, variables, inputs, and outputs have specific data types and only compatible data types can be used together. For example, you cannot pass a string output or variable to a numeric input. When you select a parameter and open the selector, a list of all variables with compatible data types will be listed. Choose the appropriate value to use it as input to the parameter. No compatible data found When using the Flow designer to configure parameters of an Action, you will only be able to select variables having compatible data types as inputs. If the variable selector display no items to select, it means that there is no compatible data available to use as input to the action."

    "keywords": "Key Concepts Profitbase Flow is an automation platform that enables users to create sequences of operations by combining triggers and actions, allowing for the expression of various business processes, rules, and data integrations. Development takes place via a web-based drag-and-drop interface, with execution options available in both cloud and on-premises environments. Tenants A tenant serves as the foundation for a client account, encompassing a subscription plan, user management, and associated billing information. Based on the the subscription plan, the tenant has access to defined set of resources like CPU, networking, and memory. While typically a company corresponds to a single tenant, it's entirely feasible for a company to create multiple tenants, each of which is billed separately. Workspaces A Workspace is a logical container of Flows and artifacts. Workspace artifacts include Workspace Variables and Workspace Objects, which are resources that can be shared by all Flows in the Workspace. A Workspace also defines which users have access to the Workspace. Workspace Objects Workspace Objects are reusable objects that consist of multiple values, for example a SQL Server connection having a server name, database name, username, and password. Instead of defining a different connection for every SQL Server action in a Flow, you can reuse an existing connection object and manage its settings once. Workspace Variables Workspace Variables are simple values that can be shared by all Flows in a Workspace, for example, a connection strings, usernames, database names or numeric values. Workspace Variables also can be used in Workspace Objects. Environments and Workspace Variables are closely related. Each Workspace variable can hold one distinct value pr environment. For example, you may define a ConnectionString variable that points to different databases for Development and Production. This functionality enables you to deploy a Flow to different environments without having to make manual changes to the configuration of the Flow when it's deployed to the target environment. Environments Profitbase Flow defines three environments: Development Test Production. While developing a Flow, you are working in one environment. To follow best practices, this should be the Development environment. Once your Flow reaches a stage where it's prepared for testing or deployment to production, you should publish it to either the Test or Production environment. This allows your users or external APIs to access a stable version of the Flow, while you can continue development of subsequent versions or features. Environments and Workspace Variables are closely related. Each Workspace variable can hold one distinct value pr environment. For example, you may define a ConnectionString variable that points to different databases for Development and Production. This functionality enables you to deploy a Flow to different environments without having to make manual changes to the configuration of the Flow when it's deployed to the target environment. Access to different environments may vary depending on your subscription plan. Typically, the Test environment is not accessible with free or lower-cost subscriptions. Flows Flows is where you define all business logic by combining triggers and actions into a sequence of operations. A Flow can be run manually from the Designer, from a 3rd party app via an HTTP endpoint, as a response to an event in an external system or scheduled on a regular basis. Triggers Use triggers to run Flows as response to events from external systems, such as incoming mail, new files uploaded to an Azure Storage Container, or a message added to an Azure Service Bus queue. A Flow can only contain a single trigger node, and the trigger node must be the first node in the Flow. If you need a Flow to react to events from multiple source systems, you can use the MultiTrigger. Actions Actions define the business logic of a Flow. Actions are combined as a sequence of operations, where each action can perform a single task. Most actions can take data as input and/or return data as output. Data returned from the action can be used as input to other actions later in the Flow, if data formats are compatible. flowchart TD Tenant[Tenant] --> Workspaces[Workspaces] Workspaces --> WorkspaceObjects[Workspace objects] Workspaces --> WorkspaceVariables[Workspace variables] Workspaces --> Environments[Environments] Environments --> Flows[Flows] Flows --> Triggers[Triggers] Flows --> Actions[Actions]"

Open and edit dimensions in specific Solutions (Work Process Versions). This enables customers to have different dimension structures in different Solutions and Work Process Versions. New dimension type: Existing dimension types are renamed to Linked Dimension and Strict Wide Dimension. Support for converting Strict Wide Dimension (previously called Dimension) to the new Dimension (enabling parent-child editing). You can use dataflows to import primary dimensions into a Solution. This enables automation of importing data from the primary dimension repository to active Work Process Versions. You can ad-hoc import data from the UI (spreadsheet import) or use Dataflows (load from SQL tables). Filter Users can now click a ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù button on items in the selected items list of TreeView filters to quickly jump to the node in the tree Support for slicing hierarchical filters based on a list of leaf-level members. Forms TreeView with support for rendering dimensions. Access Control not supported. Support for camera. Macros Support for localization API. Developers can now get information about the preferred language of the logged in user. Support for dimension metadata API. Packages and upgrades You can now specify dependencies for a Package. This simplifies Package deployment and upgrades for customers, because when you deploy or upgrade a Package, dependencies are automatically deployed/upgraded first. New Package Management tool in Designer which enables partners and customers to easily get information the Packages which are installed and upgrade them without having to open any Solutions. Support for specifying Packages as non-upgradable. Use this feature for development when you want to ensure that the Package you are working on does not get upgraded from the Package Management tool. Note that this property only applies to packages that has been deployed. Support for typing/categorization of Packages. A Package can (and should) now be categorized as either Product or Library. By doing this, it will appear in different lists in the Package Management tool, making it easier for customers / partners choose the correct Package(s) to upgrade (which in most cases should be Packages marked as Products). Profitbase Store v2 API which supports the new Package deployment and upgrade experience. Tables Support for macros in Custom Load Data queries. TableView Support for SelectionChanged API. Support for ActionLink column . Fix: Action menu items did not display text. Workbook Display mode: Ability to remove header and/or page navbar from the Workbook. This behavior can be configured in the Workbook Properties panel (Hide Header, Hide Navbar) or using query string parameters in the url. (https://my.domain.com/workbooks/123?appheader=false&navbar=false) Views Support for macros. Worksheet Support for macros in Custom Load Data queries. Selecting item from dimension member dropdown while filter is applied. Now updates the row correctly. Work Process Fix: Prevent user from deleting Work Process Version which is used as data source for another Version. Fix: Version status is not changed if ‚ÄúVersion change dataflow‚Äù does not complete successfully. Feature: Option to run ‚ÄúPost delete Dataflow‚Äù for Work Process Version. Enhancement: Enable editing Version properties after Version has been deployed. Feature: ‚ÄúMutually exclusive boolean property‚Äù enables setting a true/false Version property which is mutually exclusive for all Versions within a Work Process (for example IsCurrentVersion). Enhancement: Create new Version from older source Version. Developers can add SQL Scripts to Packages to run adapter logic when data is copied from older versions of Packages to the newer one (during Version deployment.md). Check how to do it here. Fix: Statuses in Versions list page is updated correctly during version status changes. Fix: Partially deployed Solutions are deleted on Version Deployment rollback. Misc Fix: Transaction Pipeline - Transaction pipeline Producer ignored conditional expression. Fix: Rollover + change tracking: Fixed issue that caused change history to get lost when rollover was executed. Fix: Spreadsheet - Filter did not trigger when tabbing out of filter row quickly. Macros: Added support for localization API. Breaking changes pbSimSolutionLangText has been scheduled for deprecation and will be removed in the next version (v2022.2). Use pbSimLangText for custom translations or SYS_LangText for system translations.

    "keywords": "This release of InVision mainly focuses on improvements to deploying and upgrading packages, and improvements to working with dimensions. It also contains a number of other fixes and improvements to existing features. New Features Packages Upgrade packages in multiple (versioned) Solutions We now support upgrading Packages in one or more versioned Solutions. Previously, only Packages in non-versioned Solutions were upgraded, but administrators are now given the option to upgrade Packages in versioned Solutions if the version status is either Deployed or Open. That means you can patch a version while it‚Äôs in production without creating a new version to get the fix. Support for floating dependency resolution Support for floating dependency resolution of package dependencies means that package authors have greater control over which dependencies of a Package are installed or updated. All Packages have a major.minor.patch version, for example, 2.0.1. Floating dependency resolution means that the dependency version can be defined as 2.., which means ‚Äúinstall the latest v2 release of the dependency‚Äù. Likewise, ..*, means ‚Äúinstall the latest version of the dependency‚Äù. As a package author, it means that, you can publish updates to dependencies without having to republish the main package but still have the latest dependencies installed when the main package is installed. Choose a dependency resolution rule to specify which version of the dependency is installed with the Package. Backups of Solutions are automatically deleted Backups of Solutions taken during Package upgrades are now automatically deleted if the upgrade is successful. That automatically frees up disk space without any intervention from system administrators. Support for running post-upgrade Dataflow This feature enables running a Dataflow after a Package has been upgraded. Dimension editor Support for deleting all contents in a dimension. This is often useful when you import data to a dimension for the first time and you realize that your source data is incorrect, so you need to do a complete re-import. We added an extra ‚Äú+‚Äù button to each dimension member, making it quicker to add multiple child members without having to use the context menu. Fixed issue #517. Create dimension member, change id and move a sub-hierarchy to its child collection. Fixed issue #519. Issue with drag/dropping to node while the node is being auto expanded by the system. Dimension configuration Added support for running a Dataflow after a dimension has been published. Added support for running a Dataflow after a dimension has been published to. Work Process During version deployment, dependencies between packages in the same Solution are used to determine the order of package deployment and enable custom packages/extensions to reference objects in Profitbase packages (such as Planner). Workbook Fixed issue #442 Copy/paste issue from spreadsheets in popups. Fixed dialog window resizing issue when an iframe is displayed. Forms Support for async DataChangedEventHandlers. This enables async code, such as network calls, to run when a data bound property is updated by the user. Homepage Fixed tile image max size so that oversized custom images align with the standard design. Macros We added an API for access control so that Access Group membership of the currently active user can be obtained when running macros. The MacroExpansionProvier.AccessControlService provides an API against a small subset of the InVision access control system. Methods Task<bool> IsMemberOfAccessGroupAsync(string identityId, string accessGroupName) Example This example shows how to check whether the current user is a member of the ‚ÄúAdmins‚Äù Access Group. Note We‚Äôre using Context.GetUserUniqueId() to get the id of the current user. namespace Local; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Profitbase.Invision.Scripting.Dynamic; public class MyMacros : MacroExpansionProvider { public async Task<string> GetQuery(string input) { var userIsAdmin = await this.AccessControlService.IsMemberOfAccessGroupAsync(this.Context.GetUserUniqueId(), \"Admins\"); if(userIsAdmin) { return \"IPAddress, CertificateRevocationDate, MachineName\"; } else { return \"MachineName\"; } } } Accessibility High contrast theme image picker is now working as expected, so you can easily pick images for your high contrast theme. Misc Fix issue #542 Spreadsheet dropdown column object references were not dependency resolved the @Object[‚Ä¶] directive was used. Platform version, Build number and Package info (if applicable) is displayed in the Workbook Options dialog. Platform version, Server and Desktop Build number is displayed in the Desktop Application Status Bar. Build and platform version is displayed in error dialogs. View the Platform, Build and optionally the Package version of the Workbook in the Options dialog. Platform InVision 2022.2 runs on .NET 6. All communication between application services is now using Azure Service Bus or RabbitMQ. Added support for SYS_AccessGroups SYS view. Read more here. Breaking changes Linked Fact and Dimensions (from Studio) is entirely removed from the platform (metadata and data is removed during the platform upgrade). OData feature is removed from the platform. The table pbSimSolutionLangText has been removed. Installing InVision 2022.2 To install InVision 2022.2 or upgrade to 2022.2, you need to use version 5.3 of the installation manager. Upgrading to InVision 2022.2 To upgrade to 2022.2, you need to use version 5.3 of the installation manager. Run the UpgradeDatastore.ps1 script: Download the UpgradeDatastore file below. Rename it to .zip and extract the content. (The blog platform does not allow uploading .ps1 of .zip files directly) Edit the UpgradeDatastore1.ps1 file Change $instanceToUpgrade to the name of the InVision instance you want to upgrade. If you have only one instance, or you want to upgrade all instances, set this value to ‚ÄúAll‚Äù. Change $pathToDatastoreJson to the path where Datastore.json is located. This is usually ‚ÄúC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Profitbase Installation Manager\\Scripts\\DataStore.json‚Äù. Change $pathToInstanceTemplate to the path where instancetemplate.json is located. This is usually ‚ÄúC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Profitbase Installation Manager\\Scripts\\instancetemplate.json‚Äù. Run UpgradeDatastore.ps1 Here you will find pdf with the UpgradeDatastore-1.

    "keywords": "2022.3 brings many new features and enhancements to our low-code platform. A major addition is the ability to define extensions for Packages. That enables Profitbase and partners to develop and distribute add-ons to products. You can also upgrade Packages in multiple Solutions in one go, making it much quicker to upgrade customers to new version of Planner, Risk and Consolidation. New Features & fixes Access Control SYS_ObjectPermissions The new SYS_ObjectPermissions database view enables Solution Developers to write a SQL query to check if a user has access to a Workbook or Workbook Page. Note that the UserUID is the id of the user identity in the InVision access control system, usually a GUID. It is NOT the user name, for example, name@corp.com. SELECT HasAccess FROM SYS_ObjectPermissions WHERE UserUID = 'user object id' AND ObjectID = 'workbook or workbook page id' New Access Control APIs in macros You can now check if a user has access to Workbooks or Workbook Pages using C# macros. The main difference between using the SYS_ObjectPermissions and the macro APIs is that you can use the Workbook and Page names instead of the ids when querying for user access. public async Task<string> GetQuery() { var userHasAccess = await this.AccessControlService.HasWorkbookAccess(this.Context.GetUserUniqueId(), \"Name of Workbook\"); // your code } Read more here. PowerShell Isolation of PowerShell execution context That fixes the assembly loading conflict between PowerShell modules using the same .NET assemblies or NuGet packages as the InVision platform. You no longer need to pass in pbRunContext to PowerShell APIs You no longer need to pass in pbRunContext to Profitbase PowerShell APIs. The current APIs accepting pbRunContext will still work, but they will be removed in a future version. You should make it a priority to switch to using the new APIs. Before: $bytes = [Profitbase.IO.FileStorage]::ReadAllBytes($PbRunContext, $storageName, $fileName) After: $bytes = [Profitbase.IO.FileStorage]::ReadAllBytes($storageName, $fileName) File Storage API We have added PowerShell APIs for File Storage. The API enables you to get the file information, read and delete files from File Storages using PowerShell. # Get information about file(s) in the File Storage $query = \"DepartmentID = \\\"${departmentId}\\\" && Category = \\\"${catId}\\\"\" $fileInfos = [Profitbase.IO.FileStorage]::GetFileInfos($storageName, $query) foreach($fileInfo in $fileInfos) { # Read a file $bytes = [Profitbase.IO.FileStorage]::ReadAllBytes($storageName, $fileInfo.FileName) Write-Output $fileInfo.FileName Write-Output $fileInfo.ContextJson Write-Output $fileInfo.MimeType Write-Output $fileInfo.FileReferenceId } # Delete a file [Profitbase.IO.FileStorage]::DeleteFile($storageName, $fileName) Packages Package Manager displays if a Package has dependencies with available upgrades You can now easily spot if one of the installed Packages has dependencies with available upgrades. That usually happens when a dependency has a patch release. Package Extensions We have added support for Package Extensions. That means that developers can create Packages which has the role of extending Products or Libraries. Installing an Extension requires that its dependencies are pre-installed before the extension can be installed. If an Extension extends more than one Product Package, at least one of the Product Packages must be pre-installed. Better overview of dependencies and extensions Primarily it is a developer feature. We now provide a more detailed overview of dependencies and extensions in the Package Upgrade interface. This feature lists the dependency and extension hierarchy of a Package so you can detect possible version conflicts between packages. Upgrade Packages in multiple Solutions When upgrading a Package, you can apply the upgrade to multiple Solutions at the same time. Earlier, upgrades would only be applied to Packages in Work Process Blueprint Solutions. You can now apply upgrades to Versioned Solutions that are in the Deployed or Open state. Package documentation We have added support for providing links to Package documentation and upgrade notes. Users can view the docs from the Package installation or upgrade screens. File Storage New events The Upload Completed event is raised when a file has been uploaded. That enables processing a file immediately after it has been uploaded. The File Deleted event is raised when a file has been deleted by the user. It is NOT raised if a file is deleted by the backend, for example, using PowerShell. Bug fix Fixed bug where file dialog appears behind the dialog window.

    "keywords": "New Features & fixes Spreadsheets (Worksheets + Tables) Conditions for Context Menu Options You can now specify conditions for whether a context menu option should be available to the user or not. That enables context menus to be rendered dynamically based on information from the clicked row(s) and the state of the Workbook. Use JavaScript to define conditions to whether a context menu option should be available or not. Read more about conditions for standard context menu options here Read more about conditions for custom context menu actions Table View You can now turn off the selection column This is useful if you want to save space, and only have a single select enabled. Dropdown menus auto sizes to the content width This prevents horizontal scrolling in the dropdown menus of filters. Bug fixes Fixed issue regarding null values in selector filters. This fixed a crash if your data source contained NULL in one of the columns having a dropdown filter. Fixed issue with sorting of date columns. Dates were not sorted correctly. Fixed issue with sorting of text columns where text was sorted using alphanumerical comparison instead of string comparison. Fixed issues with missing Norwegian translations. Fixed issue where scrolled text content was displayed underneath pinned left or right columns. Fixed issue where client-side filters did not properly reset after a data reload. Fixed issue where the row popdown menu was misplaced Changed checkbox filters to support tri-state (true, false, and null) for boolean fields. Forms ItemsSourceFilter API The Listbox, Dropdown, and SplitButton controls now support using a custom filter to select a subset of items from the ItemsSource. This is useful if you want to use the same data source for two or more list controls, but don‚Äôt want to display the same items. Apply a filter to the ItemsSource using the ItemsSourceFilter attribute <Form> <Data> <Models> <Model Name=\"Customer\" Source=\"@Object[Customers].DbObjectName\" Fields=\"ID,Name\" /> </Models> <Lists> <List Name=\"Customers\" Source=\"@Object[Customers].DbObjectName\" Fields=\"ID,Name\"/> </Lists> </Data> <Functions> <Function Name=\"MyFilter\" Parameters=\"items, controlName\"> return items.filter(item => item.ID !== \"Customer1\"); </Function> </Functions> <UI Grid=\"ui-root\"> <Listbox Name=\"MyListbox\" Row=\"1\" MinWidth=\"100px\" ItemsSource=\"Customers\" ItemsSourceFilter=\"MyFilter($Data, $Ctrl.Id)\" DisplayMember=\"Name\" ValueMember=\"ID\" SelectedValue=\"{Binding Path:Customer.ID}\" /> </UI> </Form> Data Binding API Solution Developers can use the new Data Binding API to retrieve all data bindings associated with a data source and force the binding targets (UI elements) to re-render. A typical use case for this feature is when multiple lists or selection controls (for example dropdowns) are data bound to the same data source, and you are using the new ItemsSourceFilter feature to ensure that the same items are not available as selectable options in any two list controls. Read more here. Selection Listbox now supports SelectedItemCssClass, which enables Solution Developers to specify a custom CSS class to apply to the selected item in the listbox. If SelectedValue is data bound, the corresponding listbox item will be highlighted. The default style of the selected item can be overridden by the SelectedItemCssClass property. <Form> <Style> <Css><![CDATA[ .selectedItem{ background-color: #404040; color: white; } ]]></Css> <Layouts> <Grid Name=\"ui-root\" Rows=\"200px 1fr\" Columns=\"auto 1fr\" /> </Layouts> </Style> <Data> <Models> <Model Name=\"Customer\" Source=\"@Object[Customers].DbObjectName\" Fields=\"ID,Name\" /> </Models> <Lists> <List Name=\"Customers\" Source=\"@Object[Customers].DbObjectName\" Fields=\"ID,Name\"/> </Lists> </Data> <UI Grid=\"ui-root\"> <Listbox Name=\"MyListbox\" Row=\"1\" MinWidth=\"100px\" ItemsSource=\"Customers\" DisplayMember=\"Name\" ValueMember=\"ID\" SelectedItemCssClass=\"selectedItem\" SelectedValue=\"{Binding Path:Customer.ID}\" /> </UI> </Form> Listbox using SelectedItemCssClass to apply a custom style to the selected item. $Ctrl keyword The new $Ctrl keyword provides information about the current UI control, such as its Id. If you don‚Äôt specify a Name for the control, it will get an auto generated id. This feature is useful in ItemTemplates where you cannot use the Name property to identify the control. A typical use case is when you have dropdowns in a listbox, and you need to track the selection of each dropdown. // Use $Ctrl.Id to pass the (auto generated) id of the control to the ItemSelected handler <Dropdown ItemSelected=\"onItemSelected($Data, $Ctrl.Id)\"/> Dynamic number of SplitButton sub-items The SplitButton control now supports dynamically adding and removing sub-items (SplitButtonItems) based on data in a data source, for example, a list. This enables having SplitButtons with a dynamic number of sub-actions based on the state in the Form Schema. <Functions> <Function Name=\"send\"> alert('send'); </Function> <Function Name=\"onClick\" Parameters=\"data\"> alert(data.id); </Function> <Function Name=\"filter\" Parameters=\"items\"> return items.filter(f => f.id == 'a' || f.id == 'b' ); </Function> </Functions> <EventHandlers> <FormEventHandler On=\"Init\"> this.addViewStateModel(\"Actions\", { splitButtons:[{ text: \"Subaction 1\", id:\"a\" },{ text: \"Subaction 2\", id:\"b\" } ] }); </FormEventHandler> </EventHandlers> <UI Grid=\"grid\"> <Grid Rows=\"auto 1fr\" Columns=\"200px 200px 1fr\"> <SplitButton Text=\"Send\" ItemsSource=\"{Binding Path:ViewState.Actions.splitButtons}\" ItemsSourceFilter=\"filter\" Click=\"send\"> <SplitButtonItemTemplate Text=\"{Binding Path:text}\" Click=\"onClick($Data)\"/> </SplitButton> </Grid> </UI> Misc The Listbox, Dropdown, and TreeView control now supports Grid as the ItemTemplate container. We added support for handling Unload of a Form Schema from the DOM. Developers can use this event to do various types of cleanup. Work Process Access control on Work Process contents We have added an option to restrict access to Work Process contents to Process administrators only. That makes all Workbooks in the Work Process unavailable to users that are not Process Administrators, even though they have been granted access through the Workbook Permissions Manager. Note that Process Administrators must still be granted regular access through the Workbook Permissions Manager in addition to being a Process Administrator to get exclusive access. Work Process Deleted event Solution Developers can now subscribe to a ‚ÄúWork Process Deleted‚Äù event which is from the Work Process Editor component when a Work Process has been deleted. That enables performing actions after a Work Process has been deleted, such as custom cleanup. Misc The web application has been updated to React 18 and the latest npm libraries. The most notable effect for end users is that the cold start loading time is improved. When exporting a Package, the package version is automatically added to the file name. Tab Control now has support for Large and Default modes. When using the Large mode, the tabs are displayed with larger text. Tab Control now has support for controlling whether or not borders should be displayed. We added support for translations of dimension names. You can use a text code to use the built-in translation system in InVision, or use the @Object[‚Ä¶].Lookup[] feature to roll your own. Breaking changes The Transaction Pipeline Producer will now include wildcard matches in addition to exact matches when resolving which transaction to generate from the rule set. This may cause more transactions to be generated from the Transaction Pipeline after upgrading to 2022.3 (depending on how the rule set table has been set up).

    "keywords": "Here is our 2022.4 release with added capabilities to Dimensions, File Storage, TableView, and Package Management. Additionally, we‚Äôve fixed many issues and added a brand new Stepper component. New Features & fixes Dimensions Extension properties Extension properties enable partners and customers to extend dimensions in installed Packages (for example, Planner) with custom properties. That makes it possible to use standard dimensions for custom Power BI reporting or EPM custom extensions. Custom properties will not be removed when the dimension is upgraded during a Package upgrade. Dimension Composition You can use Dimension Composition to build a dimension from other dimensions. You compose a dimension by adding levels and picking members from other dimensions based on their properties. That makes it easy to use different structures for input while still having one uniform reporting structure without having to maintain the same dimension members in multiple dimensions. To enable composition for a dimension, set the ‚ÄúAllow Composition‚Äù flag in the Options tab in the Designer. Launch Dimension Editor with current Solution selected You can now configure the Dimension Editor Workbook component to automatically pre-select the Solution that the Workbook belongs to, so that the dimensions displayed to the user when they navigates to the page are dimension from the current Solution and not Primary Dimensions. Bug fixes Fixed issue causing permissions set for a dimension member were not removed from the system when the dimension member was deleted. This caused access control to lock out all users not having explicit grant permissions, while based on the visible permission set, all users should have full access to the entire dimension. Fixed an issue where the Publish Dimension dialog showed the Version status as a numeric value instead of as text. File Storage File click actions The developer can specify what happens when a user clicks a file in a File Storage Workbook component. Available options are: Download ‚Äì When a user clicks a file, it will be download to the browser. Raise an event ‚Äì When a user clicks a file, an event is raise. That enables the developer to perform a custom action when a file is clicked. Open ‚Äì When a file is clicked, it will be open in the browser. None ‚Äì This enables users to view which files are in the File Storage but not access them. Table View Pr-row selectability Developers can now write JavaScript that evaluates whether or not specific rows are selectable by the user in TableView components. That provides developers fine-grained control over whether or not a row can be selected by a user based on business logic and application state. Manual trigger re-render of TableView TableView now supports manually triggering re-rendering at any time. A typical use case for when you want to trigger a re-render is when some application state outside the TableView has changed, and you want this state to be reflected in the TableView. Bug fixes Fixed issue with sorting of negative numbers. Stepper We‚Äôve added a brand-new UI component that makes it easy to guide a user through a series of steps to accomplish a task. Each step can be fully customized to contain any business logic and UI components. Package Management Package Management has several new features and enhancements, including: Detection of circular references/dependencies, Status displays correctly when updates are available for dependencies, The Package Manager loads information about a package a lot faster, Display the package as having an ‚Äúupgrade available‚Äù if there‚Äôs at least one package in a solution that‚Äôs not up to date, Solution backups are properly cleaned up. Ranked Input Tables Bug fixes/enhancements Ranked Input Tables now automatically sync with the associated dimensions when doing a Save or running Compile from Dataflows. If the source dimension has changed (been restructured), we will scan for dimension members and update the Ranked Input rows accordingly. If we cannot find a reference to the dimension members of a Ranked Input row, the row is deleted from the Ranked Input Table. Filters Enable Search on TreeView (hierarchical) filters This feature enables users to enter a search term on hierarchical filters to find matching items. This feature is enabled by default but can be turned off from the Designer. Misc Excel export: Fixed issue with Excel export from tables, where periods (.) in the table name caused the Excel export to fail, Infrastructure: Fixed issue with RabbitMQ, where queues would fill up and cause RabbitMQ to use a lot of CPU, Accessibility: Fix high contrast issue in Work Process Version Manager (#681), Dataflow: Fix the issue where the Dataflow log would not size correctly in a popup having a layout of only one row and column, Access Control: Fix the issue which made the ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù-menu disappear behind a scroll area if the description of an Access Group was long.

That will enable us to release new versions of the platform at a much higher cadence in the future, so expect a new version to drop about every 2 weeks starting January 2023. Added The Dataflow Completed event now contains a Success property that lets the developer check whether the dataflow completed with success or not. Support for installing and upgrading Packages created on older versions of InVision. This feature will enable quicker releases of InVision, because we do not have to synchronize with products such as Planner, Risk or Consolidation. Support for running PowerShell scripts from Web Functions. Fixed File Storage component displays progress/spinner when multiple files are uploaded.

We also move the platform from .NET 6 to .NET 7, which results in better performance in some key area. Workbook New API for executing Web Functions from Workbooks. Up until now, you had to use the generic Web API action to execute a Web Function, using HttpGet, HttpPost, HttpPut, or HttpDelete. This works fine, but you‚Äôd have to know the exact API endpoint (URL) to use, which shouldn‚Äôt be necessary. The new API is easier to use because you only need to provide the name of the Web Function. Note If you want to call web functions in other Solutions, you need to keep using the Http-methods (HttpGet, HttpPost, etc) and provide the full address to the web function. Read more here Use the Execute function to run the Web Function called ‚ÄúUpdateCustomer‚Äù New API for executing SQL Scripts from Workbooks If you wanted to execute a SQL script from a Workbook before 2023.1, you had to drag it onto a page from the toolbox and call the Execute action on the script. Although this is easy to do and provides a discoverable API, it has the drawback that it takes up space on the design surface of a Page. This often leads to developers creating a ‚ÄúSYS‚Äù-page where they put all their SQL scripts just so they can call them. 2023.1 introduces the Execute SQL Script action, so you can execute SQL Scripts without having to add them to a Page. Read more here Use the Execute function to run the SQL Script called ‚ÄúSubmitChanges‚Äù Forms Access Control options when displaying dimensions in Forms If you want to display a dimension in a Form, you can now choose between 3 options when it comes to access control. None ‚Äì No access control is applied. The user will see every dimension member. Standard ‚Äì Users only see the dimension members that they have access to. Custom ‚Äì The API returns every member of the dimension with a property describing the access level granted for each item. It is up to the solution developer to decide how to enforce access control when rendering the UI (for example hiding or making an item non-selectable). Read more here Table View Changed the look of the TableView filter area to make it easier to use. Fixed an issue that caused the checkbox / row selection column in Table Views to disappear after a data reload unless a layout reload was requested. The Table View now re-renders correctly when the Re-render action is executed. Platform enhancements We upgraded from .NET 6 to .NET 7, which is the latest version of .NET. We upgraded SignalR from version 1.1.0 to 7.0. All nuget packages (backend) upgraded to latest versions. All npm packages (frontend) upgraded to latest versions. Fixed an issue that prevented Workbooks from loading in IFrames after the access token was refreshed (which happens every ~1 hour). Misc fixes Fixed an issue that prevented Solution developers from reordering sibling custom context menu items in Table Views, Worksheets and Tables. Fixed an issue with dropdowns displayed in popups, where users had to select a value twice for the selection to apply.

Package upgrade Before a Package upgrade is allowed to continue, we now validate that all Views in target Solutions have valid configurations. If any View definitions are invalid, the Package upgrade is aborted immediately. After a Package has been upgraded, the access control list is automatically applied. This ensures that new Workbooks are available to users without manual steps. We will prevent users from starting a Package upgrade if any Dataflows are running in the target Solutions. All scheduled Dataflows in target Solutions are automatically suspended while a Package is upgrading. Misc Display Status bar for Worksheets, Tables and SQL Reports. Worksheets, Tables and SQL Table Reports can now display a status bar at the bottom of the spreadsheet that displays the Sum, Count and Average of selected cells in the sheets. To turn this on, enable the ‚ÄúDisplay Status Bar‚Äù property for individual Worksheets, Tables and SQL Reports in the Designer.

Change tracking and diffing We have added support for viewing any changes made to objects a Solution. To view changes, right-click the object in the Solution Explorer and open the Change log. You can see when changes to Solution objects were made, and who made the changes. You can compare two versions of an object, and pinpoint exactly what was changed. If you select a Package, you can see which objects in a Package were changed between two points in time, for example between two Package upgrades. You can right-click a Solution object in the Solution Explorer and view all changes to descendant objects. Form Schemas We have added an API for running Web Functions from Forms Schemas. This makes it easier to run backend code directly from Forms, without using the native browser API where you have to provide the Web Function url and authentication headers manually. const result = await this.webFunctions.execute(\"CalculateResult\", { a: 100, b: 200, }); console.log(\"100 + 200 is \" + result); Misc fixes Fixed an issue where the search result list in filters wrapped items with long names onto new lines instead of showing a horizontal scroll bar.

    "keywords": "2023.4 adds numerous new features for developers and end users. Continue reading to get the highlights. Package deployment and upgrade logging We‚Äôve made improvements to logging during Package deployments and upgrades: We show the Work Process Versions, Solutions, and package versions that are upgraded. If you do a multi-version package upgrade, each Package version upgrade is listed. Non-essential log messages are no longer displayed in the compact log. This makes the log very easy to read. If an error occurs, you can switch to a detailed log view to do an investigation. You can view detailed logs about previously run Package deployments and upgrades. This is useful if some error has occurred, and you need to investigate what went wrong. Data Pool We now enforce the correct data types for columns in Data Pool Compound Views, so the default SQL Server data types are not applied when view source columns contain NULL values. Dimensions and Access Control Fixed an issue where access permissions on dimension members were not deleted if the dimension member was deleted. Fixed an issue where access permissions on non-leaf dimension members were not correctly updated if the dimension was restructured. When publishing a dimension from the Dimension Editor, you will get warnings in the log if any Ranked Input tables have references to dimension members that no longer exist. The ‚ÄúPublish Dimension‚Äù dialog now displays a warning when you choose to overwrite the permissions at the target dimension(s) if the source dimension has no permissions defined. This prevents users from inadvertently deleting all permissions in a Work Process Version if they publish a primary dimension and tick the ‚ÄúOverwrite permissions‚Äù checkbox. Work Process Auto selection of Work Process Version when the user switches Work Process source version in the Create Version dialog. This change prevents the user from inadvertently creating a version from the blueprint resulting in a version with no data. When publishing a dimension from the Dimension Editor, you will get warnings in the log if any tables have references to dimension members that no longer exist. Ranked input tables Cells containing invalid references to dimension members are now displayed as #REF! instead of the row being removed. Clearing the source version dropdown in the Create Version dialog now displays a ‚ÄúBlueprint‚Äù watermark, making it obvious to the user that the new version will be created using the Blueprint as the data source. Form Schema Added the Readonly property to all input controls. Links in the RichTextEditor will now always open in separate windows or browser tabs, regardless of whether a Workbook is running in an iframe or not. Filter Fixed an issue with using search in hierarchical filters (for example TreeView) returned incorrect dimension member metadata for non-leaf members, causing incorrect data in reports when the filter was applied. PowerShell FileStorage API Added an API to programmatically add files to a File Storage. Read more Added APIs to programmatically update the context for files in a File Storage. Read more Change the context of a file using the UpdateContextByReferenceId API param ( [Parameter (MANDATORY = $TRUE)][string] $oldClaimId, [Parameter(MANDATORY = $TRUE)][string] $newClaimId ) $newContext = New-Object System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary\"[String, Object]\" $newContext.Add(\"ClaimID\", $newClaimId) $storageName = \"Files\" $fileInfos = [Profitbase.IO.FileStorage]::GetFileInfos($storageName, \"ClaimID == `\"${oldClaimId}`\"\") foreach($fileInfo in $fileInfos) { [Profitbase.IO.FileStorage]::UpdateContextByReferenceId($fileInfo.FileReferenceId, $newContext) } TableView Fixed an issue where string filters did not have a border. Fixed an issue where custom context menu actions did not work when the table was filtered. Workbook You can now use JavaScript instead of Eaze when defining business logic for component actions. By supporting JavaScript, we make it easier for new developers familiar with JavaScript to start using InVision. It also adds more flexibility, but at the same time adds a bit more complexity when working with global variables. With Eaze, any variable declared in an action handler was automatically globally available to other Workbook components as well. When using JavaScript, you need to declare global variables explicitly before they can be used. If you want to migrate from Eaze to JavaScript, you can do it gradually by changing the Script language (as shown in the screenshot below) one action handler at a time from Eaze to JavaScript. You also need to make the following changes to the existing Eaze code to make it valid JavaScript code: Global variables are not created on the fly. Instead, you need to declare them in the Variables dialog in the Workbook toolbar. @Var[‚Ä¶] is not supported. ‚Äú@Var[‚Ä¶]‚Äù is not a valid JavaScript variable name. If you need to keep using @Var while migrating, you can use the appVariables object to read and write to @Var variables. (see the example below). You must use the await keyword if you run the Web Api, Execute Web Function and Execute SQL Script workbook actions. Use Event instead of @Event in action instructions. Differences between Eaze and JavaScript // Eaze: Execute SQL script using Eaze: SetParamValue(\"@param1\", @Event.Data.customerId); _sqlScriptResponse = Execute(\"ExecSqlScriptFromWorkbook\"); // JavaScript: Execute SQL Script using JavaScript. Note the use of the await keyword and Event instead of @Event SetParamValue(\"@param1\", Event.Data.customerId); _sqlScriptResponse = await Execute(\"ExecSqlScriptFromWorkbook\"); **Use of legacy @Var-variables** this.appVariables[\"@Var[‚Ä¶]\"] = 'hello world'; Web Functions When a Web Function is pasted, the endpoint name is now automatically set to the name the developer provides. This prevents duplication of endpoint names when developers copy Web Functions and forgets to update the endpoint name of the new Web Function. Added overloads to all methods in the SqlCommandService to accept an IDictionary<string,object> for SQL parameters. Pass sql parameters to ExecuteNonQuery using a Dictionary public record ClaimSubmission(string Subject, string FromEMail, DateTimeOffset SubmittedDate, string FileName, byte[] FileBytes); public sealed class MyWebFunction : WebFunction { public async Task<IActionResult> Run(HttpRequest request) { HttpClient httpClient = this.HttpClientFactory.CreateClient(); HttpResponseMessage response = await httpClient.GetAsync(\"https://localhost:7133/AzureStorageClaims/fetch-all\"); var claimSubmissions = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<List<ClaimSubmission>>(); foreach(var claimSubmission in claimSubmissions) { var claimId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(); await this.SqlCommandService.ExecuteNonQueryAsync(\"INSERT INTO Setting_CaseBacklogtable_a0349_04062023064229147 (CaseID, Title, SubmittedDate, FromEmail) Values(@id, @title, @date, @from)\", new Dictionary<string,object> { {\"@id\", claimId }, {\"@title\", claimSubmission.Subject }, {\"@date\", claimSubmission.SubmittedDate }, {\"@from\", claimSubmission.FromEMail } }); await this.PowerShellService.ExecuteScriptByNameAsync(\"AddToClaimDocuments.powershell\", new Dictionary<string,object> { {\"fileName\", claimSubmission.FileName}, {\"fileBytes\", claimSubmission.FileBytes}, {\"claimId\", claimId} }); } return await Task.FromResult(Ok()); } } Support for defining partitions and indexes We‚Äôve added support for defining indexes and partitions on Data Stores and Tables which enables developers to significantly improve the performance of key parts of products and custom solutions. Note Partitions and indexes can be configured in the new ‚ÄúScripts‚Äù tab of Data Stores and Tables. Developers must script the entire logic related to the creation of indexes and partitions, including checking if the index or partition already exists, as shown in the screenshot below. By pressing ‚ÄúInsert template‚Äù, you get a default script with template tags that you can modify to define partitions and indexes on the table. Eaze Fixed an issue with the ArrayItemAt(collection, index) function, which did not return the expected value.

Filter We‚Äôve added support for selecting multiple values in filters programmatically. In the Set Filter Value action of a Filter, you can now call the new SetValues function and pass in an array item filter item ids. Forms Support for DropdownTreeView control We‚Äôve added support for the DropdownTreeView control, which enables displaying a TreeView in a Dropdown control. It has support for single / multi-selection, custom rendering and an API to programmatically control the behavior of the control. Extend API for the TreeView control We‚Äôve added APIs to enable developers to programmatically control the expansion state of a TreeView as highlighted in the image blow. The getExpandedNodIds also enables the developer get the current expansion state so it can be stored and re-applied later. Dimensions Fixed an issue where customers importing dimension data with cyclic references would cause dimension compilation to fail. Cyclic members will now become root members and needs to be moved to its proper location manually. Fixed an issue with dimension generation when new properties were added. Permissions and Access Control View which users have access to a Workbook You can now easily see which users have access to a Workbook through group membership, both from the Designer and Web client. Copy users from Access Group You can now easily copy users from one Access Group and paste to other Access Groups. If a user already exists, it will not be added to the target Access Group. Performance improvements Workbooks loads faster. The Workbook Menu loads faster. Filters in Workbooks loads faster. Worksheets loads faster. Developer Experience We no longer display the stack trace of error messages. If you need the stack trace for debugging purposes during development, you need to enable this feature from the System Settings menu in the Designer by setting the API Error Detail Level to Full. Upgrade notes Update Profitbase Installation Manager Before upgrading to InVision 2023.5, it important to use Profitbase Installation Manager 5.3.0.3. Installing or upgrading to 2023.5 using a previous version of Profitbase Installation Manager will fail. Change Azure Service Bus queues We fixed an issue with Dataflows that caused Dataflows to not complete execution in certain situations.

    "keywords": "The October release of InVision is here! Read the news below. New Features Component placeholder Developers can now specify placeholders (also known as skeletons) for Workbook components. When specified, the placeholder will render as a preview of the actual component until it is loaded. We currently support two types of placeholders: Animating skeleton. This placeholder does what the name suggests ‚Äì it displays an animating skeleton until the component has loaded. Static skeleton. This placeholder looks the same as the animating skeleton, but without animation. You should use placeholders when a component is displayed on a page, but not immediately loaded. This will improve the user experience by providing early feedback that work is in progress. Placeholders are currently supported by the following components: Worksheets Tables SQL Reports Forms Select which placeholder to use for a Workbook component. Placeholders are displayed until the components have finished loading. Workbook Loaded event We have added a new event which is raised when a Workbook has finished loading. The event runs after the Loading event has finished, and after all pages have finished loading. You should use this event for loading global resources or executing scripts / jobs that can wait until the initial render or the Workbook and all pages has completed. Run actions when all pages has finished loading. Excel export from Table lists You can now export to Excel from Tables in Table Lists. Changes and bug fixes Dimensions Publish dimensions: When you publish a dimension, we will no longer copy the configuration from the source dimension to the target dimension. Publishing a dimension will now only copy the dimension members and the permissions, if the user chooses that option. If the source and target dimension configurations differ by columns, properties, language settings, etc, only columns in the target matching by name will be updated with data from the source dimension. This makes it very easy to create custom solutions and reuse dimension data from other solutions (such as the Primary Dimensions), without having to use the exact same dimension configuration and dependencies. Automatic regeneration of Composite dimension when Work Process Version is deployed: We fixed a bug where Composite dimensions were not regenerated when a Work Process Version was deployed. This caused the dimension to contain data pointing to the original dimension. Gitlab issue: Composition dimention references dimensions in original solution (#371) ¬∑ Issues ¬∑ platform / InVision ¬∑ GitLab (profitbase.com) Access Control Permissions invalid after restructuring of dimensions: We fixed an issue where restructuring a dimension would invalidate all access permissions set for members below the members that were moved or added. Filters Fixed vertical alignment issue with horizontal filters components: We fixed an issue with how horizontal filters were laid out that made them difficult to align nicely with buttons or other components in the same grid track. Option to disable loading default items: We‚Äôve added a property to the Workbook Filter components that enables you to disable loading default items for specific filters. You should use this option if you set the default filter value programmatically in a Workbook, and needs to ensure that default filter value settings from the Filter configuration or the Dimension access control configuration is ignored. Spreadsheets / tables Fixed alignment issues in table and spreadsheet filter operators: We fixed an issue with the alignment of items in the operator selection menu of table and spreadsheet components. Incorrect summary details in spreadsheet status bar: We fixed an issue where selecting cells multiple times, or selecting from right to left, caused the sum and average to be incorrect. Flagging of ‚ÄúAll‚Äù level in Ranked Input tables: All cells in Ranked Input tables referring to the ‚ÄúAll‚Äù level in dimensions are now prefixed with ‚Äú*‚Äù to make it more clear to the user that an ‚Äúincludes everything‚Äù level has been selected. Package upgrade We fixed an issue where changes to the primary key of Data Stores and Tables did not trigger an update to the database table schema. We changed how Views and Compound Views are managed during Package upgrades so that invalid configurations will not cause an upgrade to fail. Dataflow Execution stability: We‚Äôve fixed an issue that caused the Dataflow execution Worker process to randomly crash, leading to Dataflows appear as running forever. Execution resiliency: Previously, if the Worker process was terminated during Dataflow execution, the Dataflow would never reach the completed state. In 2023.6, the executing task is automatically resubmitted if the Worker process executing it terminates during execution. Normally, the resubmitted task should start executing within a minute. Correct time zone handling when scheduling Dataflows from Workbook: We now handle time zones correctly when scheduling Dataflow runs from the Workbook scheduler component. This issue affected users sitting in different time zones than the server running the task. Theme changes We‚Äôve made the following changes to the default Workbook theme: Changed the color of the Workbook application bar to a darker blue color. All icons / images are now blue instead of gray. If you need a different color, create a custom theme and override the ‚Äìicon-color css variable. Changed the background selected color of row and column headers in spreadsheets from light gray to light blue. Changed the background color of row and column headers in spreadsheets from light gray to white. Changed the font color of row and column headers in spreadsheets to a lighter black. Changed the color of all borders to a lighter gray color.

Depending on which features you have used in your Solution(s), there are a few manual steps involved. Read the detailed steps about how to upgrade to InVision 4 here. New features The focus for this release has been on moving to a new, modern technology platform. We have, however, found the time to add a few new features to please y‚Äôall. Time Dimension We‚Äôve added support for creating and managing Time Dimensions directly in InVision without having to use Profitbase Studio. Monitoring and diagnostics through Application Insights We‚Äôve added support for sending telemetry information to Application Insights to enable IT departments to include InVision in their standard operations and monitoring tools and processes. This feature is enabled by default, and sends telemetry information to Profitbase unless you change the instrumentation key during installation or manually at a later point by editing the appsettings.json configuration files. Change Workbook Title dynamically You an now dynamically change the Workbook Title at any time after the Workbook has been loaded by calling the SetWorkbookTitle(‚Ä¶) command in Execute actions on the Workbook object.

    "keywords": "New features User management and Permissions Workbook components This feature enables creating Workbooks for administrators and power users to manage users, user groups and permissions to resources (data access and Workbooks) in the Solution. This means that administrators and power users no longer need to install or use the Designer (developer tool) to manage access to Workbooks and data. Integrated PowerShell support Built-in PowerShell support lets you create, manage and execute PowerShell scripts directly from InVision without having to deploy and execute them from disk on the server. We have built-in support for PowerShell Gallery and NuGet, and if you need to use modules from other sources, you can easily do that as well. Because the PowerShell scripts are executed by InVision and not an external process, you get access to InVision APIs and resources such as Directives and SQL Execution Services that makes it easy to use PowerShell as a tool to define custom business logic and automate processes in InVision. New Homepage design with Grouping support We have changed the design of the Homepage and added support for grouping of Workbooks so that Workbooks that belong to the same business processes can be grouped together. The Homepage now works better when there are many Workbooks, and it scales better to different screen sizes and form factors. Workbook Quick Navigation Menu We added a (sidebar) navigation menu to Workbooks so that you can quickly navigate between Workbooks without having to go to the Homepage. The grouping, captions and icons in the menu comes from the Homepage configuration. InVision 5 will have support for defining Workbook Menus that has their own configurations instead of relying on the Homepage configuration. Homepage configuration included in Package The Homepage configuration is now included as part of Packages, so that when business modules are deployed, the original Homepage configuration from the export is restored at the deployment site. Custom images are included in Package Deployment We now include custom images in Packages so that business modules can be restored without having to manually import custom images afterwards. Form Schema ‚Äì support for DataChangeHandler to listen for changes to objects in arrays (SetModels) Previously, if you wanted to listen for changes to specific properties in array items, for example array items in a custom Model or items in a in a SetModel, there was no easy way to do this. You could set up a listener binding {Binding Path:Model.*}, but you could not distinguish between an array item and a property directly on the model so you did not know what object the change happened to ‚Äì an array item or the Model itself. Example The following example will listen for changes to all properties of all items the OrderLines array. <DataChangeHandler Value=\"{Binding Path:Order.OrderLines.*.*}\"> do something </DataChangeEventHandler> New Directives The following new user info directives has been added, and can be used wherever @CurrentUserName currently can be used (SQL Scripts, custom queries, SQL reports, etc) **@CurrentUserUID** returns the ID or the user account from the identity provider (Windows or Azure AD) that is currently logged in. If the system is set up to use Windows AD, the SID will be returned. If the system is set up to use Azure AD, the OID will be returned. **@CurrentUserFullName** returns the full name (first and last name) of the logged in user. **@CurrentUserEMail** returns the email of the currently logged in user. Example SELECT '@CurrentUserUID' AS UserUID, '@CurrentUserFullName' AS UserFullName, '@CurrentUserEMail' AS Email Misc changes Changed font We have changed the font from Segoe UI to Roboto. This change should not cause any problems, but it‚Äôs always a good idea to check your custom screens to ensure they still look good. New look for Popups We have increased the height of the header bar and font size and added rounded corners to make the Popup look better. Enhancements Spreadsheet (Worksheet, Sql Report and Table) - Raise events from custom cell renderer. This feature makes it possible to raise events from custom cell renderers so that actions performed by users (for example clicking a button or link) can be acted upon in the Workbook. Checkout Objects in the Designer If you have a Solution Object open for edit when performing a checkout, we now automatically reload the configuration to ensure that you get the latest server version. Note Any changes you have made before checkout is discarded. Simplify Azure AD redirect URI handling #183 This enhancement makes it easier to set up the correct redirect URI in the Azure App Registration because the application will always use a lowercase redirect URI, not the casing entered by the user. Add collapse() API to Form Schema controls #137 The collapse API makes it possible to hide a Form Schema control and NOT have it take up any space in the DOM. The current hide() API hides the control, but does not collapse the space occupied by the control. Db object references in Data Flow Activity arguments will be set during Package Deployment #123 This feature enables Solution Developers to use Table parameters instead of Value parameters to pass database object names as parameters to Data Flow Items. By specifying a parameter as a Table parameter, Solution Developers can use the Table Picker instead of the @Object[‚Ä¶].DbObjectName directive to specify the database object name to pass as an argument. Form Schema ‚Äì added raiseCustomEvent() API This API replaces the current raiseWorkbookComponentEvent(‚Ä¶) API which raises the Custom event on the Form Schema component. raiseWorkbookComponentEvent(‚Ä¶) is still supported, but should be considered obsolete. The reason for this change is not a functional one, but rather for naming consistency between the APIs in the Workbook ‚Äì it makes sense that the raiseCustomEvent(‚Ä¶) raises the Custom event. Form Schema ‚Äì make it easier to style Label using the global styling system The Form Schema Label had a default system style applied that was hard to override from a Stylesheet style because of a high CSS specificity. We changed the default CSS rule to make it easy to apply a custom CSS style from a StyleSheet instead of having to use the !important property or other ‚Äúhacks‚Äù to get the CSS style to apply if it was defined outside the Form Schema CSS style. Bug fixes #193 @Language directive is not evaluated in SQL Script #180 Form schema CSS classes registered multiple times #165 Handle format strings with 0 decimals correctly #163 Linked Dimensions cannot be applied #162 Hover effect for Filter items #160 Export spreadsheet with undefined name to Excel #159 Spreadsheet filter did not display when hosted in popup #157 Form Schema Init Event runs multiple times #156 Designer Azure AD Login cache pr user #149 Dropdown text cropped #145 Enable data binding for Form Schema Input Disabled property #144 Form Schema Input control did allow entering 0 or negative values #141 Designer crash when trying to use a view that has not been materialized as a Filter source #132 Duplicate summary rows in spreadsheets #131 Workbook Page Navigated To event is not raised if page is already open #127 Designer crashes when Data Store with ghost references are opened #126 Data Store reload fails when comments are enabled on columns #94 Spreadsheet validation warning is treated as validation error #29 Typing letters into numeric spreadsheet cells causes freeze #17 Add column name validation to spreadsheet dropdown configuration #28 Do not try to save Form Schema Models when no source or SaveQuery is defined #50 Table List Data Modified event is not raised #51 Issue with compiling ranked input tables when columns have been removed from referenced dimensions Internal: Options dialog can be opened multiple times.

    "keywords": "New Features Work Process and Versioning Work Process and Versioning is a long-awaited and major feature that makes it much easier to work with multiple versions of work processes such as forecasting or budgeting. By creating a version of a Work Process, you get complete isolation of the configuration, business logic, and data within that version so users can work on separate versions of a budget, forecast, or any other business solution at any given time. Read more... Workbook as Homepage You can now configure a Workbook to be the landing page of InVision instead of the default system homepage. This enables you to create a fully customized and actionable landing page for users instead of just a Workbook launcher portal. Upgrade Packages Another major feature of this release is the ability to upgrade Packages. This feature enables content authors to roll out new features, capabilities, and enhancements to Packages already installed by customers. An example, Profitbase Planner can now be updated with new features after having been deployed. Note When a Package is being updated, the entire contents of the Package are replaced, so any customizations done to the Package are removed. How to upgrade a Package How to create a Package upgrade Package Properties The Package Properties feature enables you to define key-value pairs in Packages that can be used in your business logic. The properties can be set by the user when creating a new Work Process Version if the Package is part of the Work Process blueprint. Read more... Workbook Menu The contents of the Workbook Menu can now be fully customized using the Designer. You can also position your Work Processes in the Workbook Menu. This means you can structure your Workbook Menus the way you want according to your business needs. Read more... TableView TableView is a new Solution object for displaying data in a read-only data grid. Compared to spreadsheets which are used for editing data, TableView is used for displaying data in a user-friendly way. The component has many built-in features, for example, selection, sorting, filtering, formatting, and custom renderers. Read more... Clone Solution You can now easily clone entire Solutions from the Designer start page. Cloning a Solution will also copy input data from the source Solution, permissions, and Data Flow schedules. Note Objects in cloned Solutions are not automatically added to the Data Pool after the cloning has been completed. They will, however, be added to the Data Pool if the Data Pool Compound View is rebuilt. If you don‚Äôt want this to happen, you need to edit your newly cloned Solution and remove the Data Pool configuration from the objects that you don‚Äôt want as members of the Data Pool. Data Pool Another very cool feature is the Data Pool which enables Solution developers to expose data from different Solutions through well-known, configurable interfaces in the database. The two main components of the Data Pool coming in version 5 are the Compound View and Synonym support. The Compound View feature enables exposing data from multiple Data Stores and Views through a SQL View with a name explicitly defined by the solution developer. Data from all stores using the same Compound View name is combined into the same view. The view is automatically generated by InVision, and in addition to the data, also contains information about which Work Process Version the stores belong to (if any). This feature makes creating reports across Work Process Versions much easier, and it also makes data warehouse integrations easier as there are well-known API‚Äôs at the database level where data can be read. We have also enabled creating synonyms for Data Stores, Tables, Dimensions, and Views. A synonym is an alias or alternative name for the materialized table of the Solution object. For example, the materialized table of a Data Store has a suffix that is dynamically generated when the Data Store is deployed. This means that you cannot know what the materialized database table name of a Data Store will be. With the synonym feature, you can give the database object a well-known name that will stay the same at all deployments. Note A synonym can only belong to one object at a time, so if you need to combine data from multiple objects, use the Compound View instead of the synonym. Read more... Form Schema You can now execute functions from external components and events. A new RichText editor component enables editing and formatting rich text documents. Support for async functions enables using the await keyword in functions to avoid \"callback hell\". The new Grid panel component defines a flexible grid layout area that consists of rows and columns. It enables displaying controls, such as buttons, labels, lists, etc in a grid layout system. The new Data Service API enables developers to save and reload specific data models in a Form Schema without using the standard Save and Load actions of the Form Schema component. The new DataLoaded event runs after data has been loaded, but before the initial render. If you need to manipulate the data before it is rendered the first time, you should use this event. Data Flow Scheduler component The Data Flow Schedule component enables users to create and edit the scheduled runs of Data Flows from a Workbook instead of having to use the Designer. Read more... Show / Hide filters Filters can now conditionally and dynamically be shown or hidden, either on some state on the server, or some state on the client. Read more... System metadata information views We have added system metadata information views which provide information about solutions and work processes. These are official metadata APIs that are safe to use and will not break between versions. Read more... Worksheets and Tables You can now execute SQL Scripts defined in your Solution in Save Interception scripts. This enables reusing the same scripts in multiple save interception scripts. Dimensions We added support for defining translations for dimension members using the Designer. System The Scheduler Worker service has been replaced by the System Worker service Logs are automatically purged MVT has been ported to .NET 5 pbACUserDirectory is automatically updated from Windows or Azure AD Breaking changes Previously, JavaScripts defined in one Solution would be loaded to Workbooks in other Solutions as well. This is no longer the case. JavaScripts will only be loaded to Workbooks that are in the same Solution. Bug fixes #284 Localize doesn't work for cell validation. #276 Exiting date fields after input. #275 Ranked input selected value not updated. #264 Tab control missing HeaderTextCode. #230 dfcmdutil returns 415 error. #209 Package editor improvements. #148 Report columns should be default readonly.

    "keywords": "New Features Authentication using IBM Security Verify In addition to Windows and Azure AD, we now also support IBM Security Verify as an authentication provider. This means that customers using IBM Cloud can now use InVision, and manage identities in IBM Cloud instead of having to use Azure AD. Read more‚Ä¶ Access Control API We have added a public HTTP API which enables managing Identities and Access Group membership from 3rd party applications, such as automated scripts. This means that permissions to resources (Workbooks and Data.md can be managed using external tools without having to use the InVision Designer or the Access Control Workbooks. Read more‚Ä¶ Access Control Workbook components now supports raising a Published event The Identity Management, Access Group Management, Workbook Permissions and Data Permissions Workbook components now exposes a Published event, which enables performing custom actions after their contents have been published. Dynamic Filter headings You can now dynamically change Filter headings using the Execute Expression action of the Filter and running one or the SetHeader instructions. Read more‚Ä¶ Enhancements & Changes Configurable RabbitMQ queue names The RabbitMQ queue names can now be configured individually pr InVision instance, either using the Installation Manager when installing or upgrading, or by manually editing the appsettings.json files. This enhancement enables multiple instances of Profitbase InVision to use the same RabbitMQ broker instance. New Solution Creating a new Solution now requires specifying whether the Solution should provide contents to Work Process blueprints or not. This change was added because it was too easy to forget to set this property after a Package had been deployed. Workbook Menus in Packages Workbook Menu configurations are now included in Packages, so they will not have to be created manually after a Package deployment. It is, however, recommended to verify that the menu(s) are correct after a deployment because menus from Packages will be merged with existing menus. Rearrange items in Dropdown Package Properties Dropdown items in Package Properties can now be moved up and down using the Designer. Removed System Menu Items concept We removed the concept of having Menu Items in the Workbook Menus which were owned by the system / application platform. All menu items are now considered custom menu items without any editing restrictions. Performance improvements Package and Version deployments runs faster. Breaking Changes Access Control tables in the Solution database has been renamed. Any custom queries running against these tables must be updated to use new table names. Old table name New table name pbACGroupUser pbACIdentity pbACGroupUserMap pbACIdentityMap pbACRole pbACAccessGroup pbACRoleGroupUserMap pbACAccessGroupIdentityMap Old column names New column names pbACConsumerPermission.AcRoleID pbACConsumerPermission.AccessGroupID pbACDataPermission.AcRoleID pbACDataPermission.AccessGroupID pbACIdentity.AcGroupUserID pbACIdentity.IdentityID pbACIdentity.GroupUserType pbACIdentity.IdentityType pbACAccessGroup.AcRoleID pbACAccessGroup.AccessGroupID pbACAccessGroupIdentityMap.AcRoleID pbACAccessGroupIdentityMap.AccessGroupID pbACAccessGroupIdentityMap.AcGroupUserID pbACAccessGroupIdentityMap.IdentityID pbACSolutionPermission.AcRoleID pbACSolutionPermission.AccessGroupID pbACUserDirectory.UserGroupID pbACUserDirectory.AccessGroupID pbSolutionObjectACL.RoleID pbSolutionObjectACL.AccessGroupID Bug Fixes #283 Permissions are always copied when a Work Process Version is deployed. #274 In some scenarios, DatePicker selects the last day of previous month when the first day of a month is selected. #290 Global Data Context is not deployed with Package. #286 Work Process Version directives used in Views are not resolved during Version deployment. #292 Custom Indexes in source Solution not recreated in target Solution when Version is deployed. #306 Data Store Source mappings is not correctly remapped during Version deployment. #284 Values of Package Properties with names containing periods (.) were not saved.

It is a fundamental concept in security that minimizes risk to the business or organization. Access to resources, such as Workbooks, Data, and APIs are granted to Access Groups. Access Groups contain (identity or group) accounts from Windows or Azure AD. To each Identity and access group, you can grant access by setting Workbook and Data Permissions. Access control can be managed through an HTTP API. To manage Identities/Groups/Access Control through the API, you need an API Key and the API address.

InVision does not require you to follow any patterns or rules as to how you organize the components of the Solution. However, the recommended approach is to structure your solution components by feature/business area, not type. As an example, the structure of ¬´MySolution¬ª, containing Budget, Forecast, and Booking, may look like this: My Solution Shared Resources Content Budget ‚Ä¶. Forecast ‚Ä¶. Booking ‚Ä¶ System Namespace - Logical structuring Namespaces in InVision are used for defining the logical structure of the Solution. The contents of the toolboxes are organized based on the namespacing information specified for each Solution Explorer Object, so that it's easier to navigate and find what you're looking for. Namespaces are inherited based on the physical structure of the Solution, meaning a descendant node will belong to the same namespace as its ancestor having a namespace specified. If an unrooted namespace is assigned to a node, the namespace will become a sub-namespace of the ancestor namespace, and the node and its descenants will belong to the new (sub) namepace. Namespaces can be rooted at any level, meaning that a new top-level namespace can be created for any node if you don't want a node (and its descendants) to inherit the namespace from one of its ancestors. To create a new root namespace, the namespace name must start with two colons (\"::\"), for example ::My New Namespace. Example Given the following physical Solution structure with namespace definitions highlighted in bold My Solution (Solution) Budget (Budget) Data Flows Budget Flow 1 Budget Flow 2 Budget Full Processing (::Global/Data Flows) Data Stores Salary Assets Booking (Booking) Data Stores Courses Data Flows Booking Flow 1 Booking Full Processing (::Global/Data Flows) A toolbox displaying the Data Stores in the Solution will have the following structure Solution Budget Salary Assets Booking Courses A toolbox displaying the Data Flows in the Solution will have the following structure Solution Budget Budget Flow 1 Budget Flow 2 Booking Booking Flow 1 Global Data Flows Budget Full Processing Booking Full Processing"

    "keywords": "Class Libraries contains the functions (business logic) being executed by Data Flow Items. Class Libraries can be written directly in Data Flow Item as Scripts, or using any tool able to produce a .dll and then linked into InVision by referencing the .dll(s). The process of turning a Class Library into executable code is called compiling, and a compiled class library is called an Assembly. Creating Class Libraries Class Libraries contains one or more classes with methods which are compiled into assemblies that can be executed by Data Flow Items. In order for the Infinity runtime to be able to recognize and execute the code, the classes and methods must be annotated with ScriptClass and ScriptMethod attributes. ScriptClassAttribute Namespace : Profitbase.AppFramework.Infinity.Runtime Assembly : Profitbase.AppFramework.Infinity.Core (in Profitbase.AppFramework.Infinity.Core.dll) The ScriptClass attribute is used for annotating classes containing executable code for the Infinity runtime. Classes not annotated by the ScriptClass attribute cannot be referenced or called from Data Flow Items. The class is identified by its namespace and its class name on the form, mynamespace.myclass. Property ClassId can be used for specifying an identifier for the class instead of the default namespace and class name. namespace MyCompany.Tasks { using System; using Profitbase.AppFramework.Infinity.Runtime; [ScriptClass] public class Calculator { } [ScriptClass(\"AdvancedCalculator\")] public class AdvancedCalculator { } } The Id of the Calculator class will be MyCompany.Tasks.Calculator. The Id of the AdvancedCalculator class will be AdvancedCalculator, since we‚Äôre using the ClassId property of the ScriptClass attribute to set the class id explicitly. ScriptMethodAttribute Namespace : Profitbase.AppFramework.Infinity.Runtime Assembly : Profitbase.AppFramework.Infinity.Core (in Profitbase.AppFramework.Infinity.Core.dll) The ScriptMethod attribute is used for annotating methods that can be executed by the Infinity runtime. Methods annotated with the ScriptMethod attribute are the public API of the Class Library. Methods not annotated by a ScriptMethod attribute cannot be referenced or called from Data Flow Items. The method is identified by the class id and the method id on the form classid.methodid. The method id matches the method name unless a different method id is specified using the MethodId property of the ScriptMethod attribute. A method id must be globally unique, meaning that in order to use method overloading, you need to use the MethodId property of the ScriptMethod attribute to specify unique names if you have two public methods with the same name. Property MethodId can be used for specifying a method id instead of the method name. namespace MyCompany.Tasks { using System; using Profitbase.AppFramework.Infinity.Runtime; [ScriptClass] public class Calculator { [ScriptMethod] public double Add(double a, double b) { return a + b; } } [ScriptClass(\"AdvancedCalculator\")] public class AdvancedCalculator { [ScriptMethod(\"Sub2\")] public double Sub(double a, double b) { return a ‚Äì b; } } } The Id of the Add method will be MyCompany.Tasks.Calculator.Add. The Id of the Sub method will be AdvancedCalculator.Sub2, since we‚Äôre using the ClassId property of the ScriptClass attribute to set the class id and the Method Id of the ScriptMethod attribute to set the method id explicitly. Developing and deploying Class Libraries using Visual Studio This section describes how to develop, deploy and debug Class Libraries using Visual Studio. To set the stage, we‚Äôll create a class library for the imaginary company Hypotesia: In Visual Studio, create a new Class Library project (File -> New ->** Project‚Ä¶ Windows | Class Library**). We‚Äôll call it Hypotesia.BusinessLogic. Create a new public class for your business logic. Add a public method to the class. Next, we need to make the class and method discoverable and executable: Add a reference to Profitbase.AppFramework.Infinity.Core.dll. To find it, browse to the \\bin folder in the Designer website, or to the Worker service install folder. This assembly contains the core runtime types that enables your code to be discovered and executed by the Infinity Runtime. In your class file, add a using statement to the Profitbase.AppFramework.Infinity.Runtime namespace. Add a ScriptClass attribute to your class. Add a ScriptMethod attribute to your method. To make your functions discoverable by the Designer, you need to copy the assembly (.dll) to two folders and register them with the application. Now you can use them in your Solution, and enable the Infinity Runtime to execute them. In the Solution Explorer, open the Project Properties: Go to Build Events. Add the following Post-build event command line commands: xcopy \"$(TargetDir)Hypotesia.BusinessLogic.dll\" <path to worker service> /y xcopy \"$(TargetDir)Hypotesia.BusinessLogic.dll\" <path to designer website bin folder> /y Note! You may not have permissions to write to these folders by default. If not, open Properties for each folder and go to Security -> Edit, and make sure you have at least Modify, Read and Write permissions. Navigate to <designer website folder>\\InVisionServices\\Data and open DPDServiceConfig.Custom.xml for editing. (Make sure you have at least write and modify permissions). Add the following line to the ScriptAssemblyReferenceCatalog element. <ScriptAssemblyReferenceCatalogItem LibraryName=\"Hypotesia BusinessLogic\" AssemblyFile=\"Hypotesia.BusinessLogic.dll\" Version=\"1.0\"/> (If you copy this line into the xml file, make sure to fix the quotes). Copying the .dll to the Worker Service folder enables executing your code in Data Flows, because Data Flows are executed by the Worker Service. Copying the .dll to Designer website and registering it enables you to use it as part of your Solution and configure the execution. Once you have everything set up, you can go ahead and build your project. If you have everything set up correctly, your code should be compiled into assemblies and copied to the two folders. Once that‚Äôs done, you can go to the Data Flow Item designer, add a reference to the assembly then create tasks using your classes and methods. Debugging code using Visual Studio Once a Class Library has been compiled into an assembly and deployed to the Worker Service, you can debug it from Visual Studio by attaching to the (Worker Service) process, dfworker.exe. Note! In order to attach to the dfworker.exe process, make sure you‚Äôre running Visual Studio as Administrator. To attach to a process: Go to Debug (in the Visual Studio menu bar) ->Attach to Process‚Ä¶(or Ctrl+Alt+P). In the list of Available Processes, find dfworker.exe and attach to it. If you cannot find dfworker.exe, enable Show processes from all identities below the list. Once you have successfully attached to the process, add break points to your code by pressing F9 or by clicking the left margin. Statements with break points are (normally) indicated by red circles in the left margin and a red background. Go to InVision and execute a Data Flow that calls your code. When your break points are hit, you can step through and debug your code as if you were running the .dll in your own process."

These values can be found in Workbook variables, and mapped to Data Context Variables. Note When mapping Workbook variables to Data Context Variables, you reference the Workbook variable by name, not by value, meaning you can‚Äôt use the @Var[‚Ä¶]-expression, just the name of the variable. Example A Data Flow should process data related to a specific project. In this case, the Workbook does not have a project filter, but a project id still need to be be part of the Data Context in order to ensure that only transactions related to the specific project is being processed. To make this happen, the following configuration can be applied. **1) **Define a variable, ¬´ProjectID¬ª, in the Globale Data Contexten and bind it to the appropriate column (ProjectID) in the Data Store(s) using a Value Binding. **2) **Create a Workbook variable, for example ¬´ProjectID¬ª and assign a value to it. (_state.ProjectId = xyz) **3) **In the Data Context Scope of the Data Flow, add a mapping from the Workbook variable to the Data Context variable. Make sure you don‚Äôt use the @Var[‚Ä¶]-syntax when referring to the Workbook Varialble, just the actual name of the variable. Use Data Context variables as Data Flow Activity arguments If you are executing Data Flows during Workflow state transitions and want to use Data Context variables to set arguments for the Data Flow Activities, you simply need to enter the name of the Data Context variable as the argument. By doing this, the value of the variable will be passed as an argument to the activity during execution. Data Storages In cases where data sources and targets in a processing chain contains data having equal dimensionality but are logically different based on where it is stored, you can enable the Data Context to take into account the origin of the transactions being processed by setting up the Data Storages of the Data Context Scope. Filtering on Data Storages are usually supplemental to using Filters and Variables. Alternatively, you can use the SYS_DataSetID Workbook Variable if you are running in a Workflow context. Data Context Delegation Data Context Delegation is the concept of delegating the Data Context information to different columns than the columns that Data Context Slicer Repositories are associated with. For example, if the Department dimension (DC Slicer Repository) is associated with the DepartmentID column of a Data Store, View or Setting, the DepartmentID would normally be the Data Context column used for determining which transactions to process and delete when a Data Context is applied to the exeution of a Data Flow. However, if you run processes that produce data from one Department to another (such as the Spawner may do), and you want to associate the offspring transactions with their parent transactions, you need to delegate the Data Context information to a different column than the DepartmentID column. In order to do this, you need to add a DepartmentID_DCD (DCD stands for Data Context Delegate) column to the targets of the processing pipeline. Data Context Delegate columns are identified by the reserved _DCD postfix, for example DepartmentID_DCD. All columns in a Data Store, View or Setting with the _DCD postfix are considered Data Context Delegate columns in a processing pipeline, and must not be used for anything else. To enable Data Context Delegation for a database object, all you need to do is add corresponding _DCD columns for each \"standard\" Data Context column that you want to enable delegation for."

    "keywords": "The Global Data Context is configured once pr Solution, and specifies the resources and bindings used to determine the transaction set to process when the star schema configuration of Data Stores cannot provide this information, and / or when Data Context Scopes cannot be fully configured in Workbooks. The Global Data Context is defined by Slicer Repositories, Data Context Variables and Data Context Subjects. Slicer Repositories Slicer Repositories are table resources (Dimensions, Facts, Settings and Data Stores) that can be used to determine the transaction set to process when a data source (Data Store or View) does not have a star schema that the Data Context can be derived from. Once a table resources is registered in the Global Data Context, it can be applied in Slicer Repository Bindings for Data Context Subjects. Properties: Repository The Solution Object (Setting, Data Store, Fact or Dimension) used for filtering the set of transactions to process. Name The name of the Data Context Resource. The name is used for referencing the resource in Slicer Repository Bindings. Data Context Variables Data Context Variables are declarations of resources that can be referenced in Value Bindings when arbitrary values should be used to determine the transaction set to process. Values are assigned to Data Context Variabels listed in the Data Context Scope definition of Data Flows, by mapping Workbook variables to the Data Context Variables. Properties: Name The name of the resource. The name is used for referencing the resource in Value Bindings. Data Context Subjects Data Context Subjects are data sources and targets which are sliced by the Data Context during processing. Data Context Subjects can be Data Stores or Views. If the star schema configuration of a Data Store provides sufficient information to determine the transaction set during read and write operations, the Data Store does not need to be enlisted in the Global Data Context. Since Views does not have a star schema configuration, any View being part of a contextual data processing must be enlisted in the Global Data Context. Properties: Subject The Solution Object (Data Store or View) to have its transaction set managed by the Data Context during processing. Repository Bindings A collection of Slicer Repository Bindings. Value Bindings A collection of Value Bindings. Slicer Repository Binding Slicer Repository Bindings are used if a Data Context Subject does not have a star schema configuration (such as Views) or if the table resources used for filtering the transaction set during processing does not exist in the star schema configuration. Slicer Repository Bindings supplements the star schema configuration of Data Stores by providing a connection between Data Store columns and a columns in a Slicer Repository. Properties: Target Column The name of the column in the Data Context Subject table (Data Store or View), used for filtering the transaction set read or written to during processing. Slicer Repository The Slicer Repository used for filtering transaction set. Slicer Repository Column The name of the column in the Slicer Repository used for matching the values in the Data Context Subject Target Column. Value Binding Value Bindings defines connections between Data Context Variables and a Data Context Subject columns. If a value has been assigned to a variable through the Data Context Scope, the value is used for determining the transaction set being processed. The difference between using Slicer Repository Bindings and Values Bindings for filtering, is that when using Slicer Repositories, the filtering is done by joining the Subject Column on the Slicer Column and applying a WHERE clause on the Slicer Column(s), while using Value Bindings, the WHERE clause is applied directly to the Subject Column. Also, Value Bindings allows using hard coded filtering values. Properties: Target Column The name of the column in the Data Context Subject table that the filter should be applied to. If a value has been assigned to the variable, the the value will be used for determining the transaction set to process. Variable The Data Context Variabel used holding the value used for filtering. Scripting the Global Data Context When creating a template that requires a Global Data Context configuration, you need to include a script to create the GDC at the end of the template deployment process. To do this, you need to create a Data Flow that executes when the template is deployed, an in that Data Flow, add a task that calls the Profitbase.Invision.Cmd.ExecuteScript function. The easiest way of doing this is to add it from the Data Flow Item Templates toolbox -> Command Tasks -> Execute Command Script. In the GDC screen, generate the script and copy it into the Command Script text input field of the Execute Command Script Task in the Data Flow Item."

All Data Stores being sources or targets in a processing chain must have a Data Context specified for InVision to figure out which set of transactions to process. If you do not set up a Data Context, you must configure the transaction filtering manually. The Data Context of a Data Store is normally determined based on the Dimensions which are a part of the star schema. If one or more Filters based on star schema Dimensions are connected to the Data Context Scope of a Data Flow, the selected filter values will be used to determine which transactions to process. All sources and targets in a processing chain must have a Data Context because the Data Context Scope controls not only which transactions are being read from the sources, but also which transactions are being deleted from the targets. To enable other resources (dimensions not being part of star schemas, tables, and custom values) to determine the transaction set being processed, you need to define them in the Global Data Context.

Refresh (dropdown under Join): refresh the status shown below the name. View Information (dropdown under Join): brings up a dialog displaying details for the view. Browse Data: brings up a browser to view data in the Compound View. Note A Store or View can only be a member in one Compound View. Synonym A synonym can be applied to Data Store, Dimensions (linked and local.md), Tables, and View. Synonyms are using the Microsoft SQL Server synonym functionality with some additions.

    "keywords": "Data Stores Data Stores are the primary data repositories of your Solution. Data Stores should be used for storing the master data and processing results for your business modules, while Tables should contain configuration data for business rules and utility functions. Data Stores are materialized as SQL Server tables and can be read and written to by any SQL script or process having the required permissions. Data is stored \"as is\", so you do not need to use an InVision API to read or write data to a Data Store. This makes it easy to integrate with other tools, such as Excel or a custom Web Service, to export and import data to and from InVision. The table schema of a Data Store is configured by adding columns and setting up properties for each column. Constraints and data sources are defined by adding dimensions and fact to the setup, and binding columns from the (fact and dimension) data sources to the columns in the Data Store. By binding dimensions and facts to the table schema of a Data Store, you create a star schema. You should consider binding dimensions to Data Stores when you want to make it easy to: Enable foreign key constraints Create Worksheets with dropdown editors for selecting cell values (for example Accounts, Projects, Products, etc) Create Worksheets where the data set presented to the end-user should be filtered by dimension. Create Worksheets where you want to ensure identities only have access to data based on identity rights. Use the Core Set function to (pre)populate the Data Store. Specify a mechanism used for resolving the Data Context when processing data using Data Flows in a Workflow context. In addition to the core setup of the Data Store where you define the schema and how data is loaded and updated to the store, you can specify a range of features and behaviors which enable different kinds of applications of the Data Store. The features and behaviors include Rollover, Periodic Input, Core Set, and Transaction Pipeline.

For Change Tracking to work, you need to enable it for the Data Store or Data Store Group. You can enable or disable Change Tracking from the Properties tab in the Data Store or Data Store Group designer. In addition to enabling Change Tracking for a Data Store, you need to specify which columns should be change tracked. To enable Change Tracking for a Data Store column, you need to set its Track Changes property to True. When Change Tracking is enabled for a column added to a Worksheet, the user can right-click a cell in the column to view the changelog for that particular cell. When Change Tracking is enabled for a Data Store, a Change Tracking Table is created in the database. The Change Tracking table has the same name as the Data Store table with a \"CHNG\" postfix, so for example if the Data Store table is called \"Store_Budget_20150101115318\", the associated Change Tracking table is called \"Store_Budget_20150101115318_CHNG\". The Change Tracking table contains information about which row and column were changed, the new value, who changed, what time it was changed, and the type of change operation performed (Insert, Update or Delete).

The Core Set basically defines which rows should always be present in the Data Store, regardless of whether it exists in the fact source(s) or not. When the Core Set has more than one member, the data set produced by the Core Set feature is the Cartesian product of the rows from all the Core Set members. The Core Set feature runs after a reload or update, so rows produced by the Core Set will only be added to the Data Store if they have not been added during previous steps. The Core Set feature uses the relationship bindings of the Data Store to determine whether a row should be added or not. For example, suppose you have the following 2 rows in the Data Store. The rows were originally imported from a fact source, meaning the fact source only contains two rows. AccountID ProductID Amount Deviation 3000 PY-9983 1000 -250 3000 PY-9975 5000 150 Next, you set up the Core Set feature to include the Account and Product dimensions. The Account Dimension contains accounts 3000 and 3001, while the Product Dimension contains products PY-9983, PY-9975, and PY-9900. After running a data update (or reload), the Data Store will contain the following rows: AccountID ProductID Amount Deviation 3000 PY-9983 1000 -250 3000 PY-9975 5000 150 3000 PY-9900 NULL NULL 3001 PY-9983 NULL NULL 3001 PY-9975 NULL NULL The Core Set feature adds rows to the Data Store by combining the content of the Core Set dimensions and then adds the missing rows to the Data Store. Core Set Members The Core Set Members are the table resources used for producing the Cartesian product of rows that makes up the core data set of the Data Store which is the rows that should always be present in the repository.

Data Stores should be used for storing the master data and processing results for your business modules, while Tables should contain configuration data for business rules and utility functions. Data Stores are materialized as SQL Server tables and can be read and written to by any SQL script or process having the required permissions. Data is stored \"as is\", so you do not need to use an InVision API to read or write data to a Data Store. This makes it easy to integrate with other tools, such as Excel or a custom Web Service, to export and import data to and from InVision. The table schema of a Data Store is configured by adding columns and setting up properties for each column. Constraints and data sources are defined by adding dimensions and fact to the setup, and binding columns from the (fact and dimension) data sources to the columns in the Data Store. By binding dimensions and facts to the table schema of a Data Store, you create a star schema. You should consider binding dimensions to Data Stores when you want to make it easy to: Enable foreign key constraints Create Worksheets with dropdown editors for selecting cell values (for example Accounts, Projects, Products, etc) Create Worksheets where the data set presented to the end-user should be filtered by dimension. Create Worksheets where you want to ensure identities only have access to data based on identity rights. Use the Core Set function to (pre)populate the Data Store. Specify a mechanism used for resolving the Data Context when processing data using Data Flows in a Workflow context. In addition to the core setup of the Data Store where you define the schema and how data is loaded and updated to the store, you can specify a range of features and behaviors which enable different kinds of applications of the Data Store. The features and behaviors include Rollover, Periodic Input, Core Set, and Transaction Pipeline.

    "keywords": "Rollover is the process of transitioning forward in time from one period to another. Executing a Rollover usually involves moving data from one period over to another and updating the Time Frame Reference Date. The process may also contain updating or refreshing data from source systems and performing calculations. To enable Rollover for a Data Store or Setting, you first need to set up the Time Frame and add Time Frame Measure Columns to the repository schema. Once the Time Frame is set up, you need to go to the Rollover section in the Feature tab to enable Rollover for the repository by checking ¬´Is Rollover Enabled¬ª. Rollover Columns Specifies which columns to roll over new periods. You need to specify which columns to roll over, because you would normally not want all Time Frame Measure columns to roll over. As an example, you would probably not execute rollovers for columns containing Actuals, but rather refresh data for these columns from the Data Warehouse when transitioning to a new period. Is Cyclic Specifies that the rollover should be cyclic, meaning data from columns leaving the Time Frame window will loop back and reappear from the tail of the window. For example, if you are running a 12 months continuous forecast, enabling cyclic rollover will copy data from January of the current year to January next year, giving you a decent starting value for that period. Update from Source When setting up Rollover for Data Stores, specifies whether to update data from the data sources after a Rollover. Updating the Data Store is done after the Rollover has completed and the Time Frame has been updated, but prior to executing any post-update Rollover Calculations. Don‚Äôt update data (default) The standard rollover is executed. The Data Store does not update from the source. Update data Executes the rollover, then updates the Data Store according to the Data Update Configuration before executing any post-update Rollover Calculations. Reload data Executes the rollover, the reloads data to the columns bound to the data source(s) in the schema configuration. Note that any rollover columns bound to the data sources will also be reloaded. Being a rollover column does not prevent reloading data for the column if this setting is applied. Rollover Calculations Specifies column calculations to run before and after the Rollover. To set up a column calculation, add a column to the Rollover Calculations list and enter the SQL expression for calculating the value. The expression supports directives. A calculation can run before and after the Rollover. If you want a calculation to run both before and after the Rollover, you need to add the column twice and enable one to run after the Rollover. Post-rollover calculations will run after a Data Store update. Videos Data Stores Rollover Calculations"

Value() When used in a Spawner Ruleset Condition expression, returns the Value of the row currently being processed.

T CurrentPeriodValue<T>() If used when the Distributer is enabled, and the transaction being processed is generated by the Distributer, this function returns the value of the Time Frame Column in the Data Store that has a date matching the Transdate of the generated row. The Transdate of the generated row is created form based on the Time Frame information of the distribution factor column that was used for generating the value of the transaction.

When calling CurrentPeriodValue<int>() from the Spawner for row number 6, 0 is returned. The reason for this is that Transdate of row number 6 matches the Time Frame date of column Col06 in the Data Store. bool CurrentPeriodValueNotNullOr<T>(T value) Checks if the value of the Computation Source Column for the current time slot is not equal to NULL or the provided value. Example Check if the value of the current time slot is not null or equal to 100. CurrentPeriodValueNotNullOr<decimal ?>(100) T ValueOfCurrentDistributionKey<T>() double?

You should only use this option if you need to explicitly specify the distribution key to use in addition to the Relationship configuration. Type Id Column Data type must be character based, for example nvarchar(50). A pipeline component iterates over the columns listed as Computation Source Columns in the component Input section and figures out which business rules to apply for generating output. Normally, every column in the list will have a separate rule set, and the TypeID column is used for specifying the rule set name. If you want to apply the same rule set to multiple Compuration Source Columns, you can use the same Type Id value for those columns. For example, if you want do distribute \"YearTotal\", and \"NextYearTotal\" the Type Id column of the Rulset would normally contain rows where the TypeId Column is \"YearTotal\" and \"NextYearTotal\" (in addition to any other Relationship keys). If, however, you wanted to use the same distribution key for both of the columns, you could just use a common value for both the \"YearTotal\" and \"NextYearTotal\" columns. Factor Columns Specifies the columns of the Rulset that makes up the actual distribution key. As indicated, each value of a distribution key is a factor, so only the ratio between them matters, not the actual sum of the columns. (For example, the sum of the factor columns does not have to be 100 (%)). These columns must be Time Frame Measure Columns because they specify the date to use when date-value pairs are written to the target.

A Transaction Pipeline process consists of a Cell Adapter, Distributer, and Spawner component, which all produce output by evaluating business rules. The business rules (Ruleset) are configured in the Feature section of Setting tables, using one Setting table pr feature configuration. (For example, you cannot use the same Setting table to configure business rules for both Cell Adapter and Distributer components). Note! All Transaction Pipeline target Data Stores must have Tracing Columns. Also, unless you intend for the entire source transaction data set to be reprocessed every time the pipeline is executed, you need to ensure that the Data Context for both the Transaction Pipeline source and target Data Stores have been properly defined.

    "keywords": "Dimensions lets you define hierarchical data structures which can be used in filters and reporting, both within Profitbase InVision, and in 3rd party tools such as Power BI. Dimension can have any number of levels, and each level has an id, name, and optional translations for different languages. Dimension can also have properties, which is a way to define ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù of dimension members (for example, weight, color, length, etc.). Dimensions are always stored as wide tables in the database, but you can edit them as parent-child hierarchies in the dimension editor. Each level in the dimension is represented by at least two columns in the wide table ‚Äì an Id and a Name column. The Id column contains the id of the dimension member, and the Name column contains the text displayed to the user. If you enable language support, there will be a Name column for each language. Key Field specifies the name of leaf level column, for example ProductID or AccountID. The example below shows the columns in a table for a two-level dimension (L1 and ProductID), having ‚ÄúProductID‚Äù as Key Id, translations for English and Norwegian (EN and NO), and a Weight property. The table includes a SortIndex column that specifies how siblings are sorted (not shown in the example below). How to create a dimension Start the Designer and open a Solution. In the Solution Explorer, right-click a Folder and choose ‚ÄúAdd Item‚Äù, then choose ‚ÄúDimension‚Äù from the list. Provide a name for the Key Field. The Key Field specifies the name of the column at the leaf (lowest) level of the wide table. Enable support for multiple languages If you want to enable the dimension to support different languages for displaying members, select one or more languages in the Languages dropdown. The language-specific names for each dimension member are managed in the Dimension Editor. Primary Dimension Specifying a dimension as a Primary Dimension means that it appears in the list of \"primary dimensions\" in the Dimension Editor without users first having to select a specific Solution. That gives Power users a central repository of dimensions they can edit and publish to Work Process Versions or other solutions. Think of primary dimensions as a central repository of dimensions that can be modified and published into production. Properties Dimension members can have zero or more properties. For example, products in a Product dimension can have properties such as weight, height, color, etc. Each property is materialized as a column in the dimension table. Property Id This is the Id of the property field and the name of the column in the dimension table in the database. Name Name specifies the label of the property in the Dimension Editor user interface. You can also provide specific translations for the label using this field. Data type Specifies the data type of the property. Is Lookup Use this feature if you want users to select from a set of predefined values when setting the value of the property. Extension properties Extension properties enable partners and customers to extend dimensions in installed Packages (for example, Planner) with custom properties. That makes it possible to use standard dimensions for custom Power BI reporting or EPM custom extensions. Custom properties will not be removed when the dimension is upgraded during a Package upgrade. Level names By default, column names for all levels except the leaf level are auto-generated using the format L[level number], for example, L1, L2. If you want to override the naming for each level column, you can specify this in the Level Names list. Options / Empty member If you need the dimension to always contain an empty member, enable the Include Empty Member option. This option is typically used when you are using the dimension as a source for a dropdown in a spreadsheet, and users must be able to select a ‚Äúnull‚Äù or ‚Äúnot applicable‚Äù value. Options / Dimension Composition Go to Dimension Composition. Build the dimension and edit dimension data To build the dimension and edit data, you need to use the Dimension Editor in a Workbook. In the Designer, check the ‚ÄúPrimary Dimension‚Äù in the toolbar. That will make the dimension appear in the Primary dimensions dropdown in the Workbook Dimension Editor. Create a new Workbook. In the Toolbox, choose the Resources tab and drag/drop the Dimension Editor onto a page. Open the Workbook and choose a dimension from the list of available ones. Adding members to a dimension using the tree editor To add a new root dimension member, click the ‚Äú+‚Äù button at the top of the dimension tree To add a new member as a child of another member, choose ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù from the action menu of an existing item (hover the item to make the menu trigger appear). Adding members to a dimension by importing from clipboard/Excel To import multiple members at the same time, click the Import button at the top of the dimension tree. This will display a table editor that lets you copy/paste data from Excel (or any other tab-delimited file). Note that you need to use Ctrl-V to paste into the table. You cannot right-click a cell in the table editor. Organizing dimension members To organize dimension members in a hierarchical structure, you can do the following: Drag/drop nodes between levels. Use the action menu which appears when you hover a node to add, delete, cut, paste, and clone members. To move multiple items, hold down the Ctrl key while selecting multiple members. Then use the ‚ÄúCut‚Äù and ‚ÄúPaste‚Äù options in the action menu to move the items as children to a different member. To sort children of an item, open the action menu and choose one of the sorting options available. The sorting options are only available on items in the tree which have children. Edit data in table mode You can edit properties and dimension member names (including translations) using Table Edit mode. That enables users to quickly edit data for multiple dimension members using data grid functionality like drag-copy of cells and copy/paste. While in Table Edit mode, you cannot edit the tree in any way, and you cannot switch back to the Properties tab until you have saved any changes. Note * When you are in Table Edit mode, you must remember to save your changes before choosing a different dimension member from the tree, or else all your changes are lost.* Preview dimension in different languages If you want to preview how the dimension looks in different languages, use the ‚ÄúGlobe‚Äù icon at the top of the dimension tree to switch between different languages you have enabled for the dimension. Publishing a dimension The changes you make in the Dimension Editor are not fully applied until you have published the changes. That means that you can edit the data and hierarchy, save it, and continue working until you are satisfied with the result. Before applying those changes to the actual data model used by Data Stores, Filters, Tables, etc. When you publish a dimension, it will always be published to the Solution which owns it. Additionally, you can optionally choose to publish the dimension to other Solutions and Work Process Versions as well. When you choose Solutions and/or Work Process Versions to publish to, the dimension will be published to dimensions in the target Solutions and Work Process Versions having the same name as the dimension being published.

How to Configure Translation of Dimensions Name Open the Dimension in the Designer, Go to the Properties tab, In the Name Expression field, provide either a text code that is registered in the Localization table, or use the @Object[...].Lookup[condition][ValueColumn] directive to use a custom table for translations. Option 1 Use text code translations. In the Name Expression field, add a text code, for example, Account: Add a translation to the Custom Texts table in the Localization screen if it does not already exist: Option 2 Use the @Object[...].Lookup directive. Create a table to store the translations. For example, it can contain the columns Name, LangID and LangText. In the Name Expression field, use the @Object[...].Lookup directive to specify the translation For example @Object[Custom Translations].Lookup[{\"Name\": \"PC Dim\", \"LangID\": \"@LanguageTwoLetter\"}][LangText] The lookup will search the Name and LangID columns for the values matching the criteria (\"PC Dim\" and @Language), and then return the value found in the LangText column. Note that @LanguageTwoLetter is a special keyword recognized by the system, which has two-letter language code of the currently logged in user, for example, EN or NO."

    "keywords": "Dimensions Dimensions lets you define hierarchical data structures which can be used in filters and reporting, both within Profitbase InVision, and in 3rd party tools such as Power BI. Dimension can have any number of levels, and each level has an id, name, and optional translations for different languages. Dimension can also have properties, which is a way to define ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù of dimension members (for example, weight, color, length, etc.). Dimensions are always stored as wide tables in the database, but you can edit them as parent-child hierarchies in the dimension editor. Each level in the dimension is represented by at least two columns in the wide table ‚Äì an Id and a Name column. The Id column contains the id of the dimension member, and the Name column contains the text displayed to the user. If you enable language support, there will be a Name column for each language. Key Field specifies the name of leaf level column, for example ProductID or AccountID. The example below shows the columns in a table for a two-level dimension (L1 and ProductID), having ‚ÄúProductID‚Äù as Key Id, translations for English and Norwegian (EN and NO), and a Weight property. The table includes a SortIndex column that specifies how siblings are sorted (not shown in the example below). How to create a dimension Start the Designer and open a Solution. In the Solution Explorer, right-click a Folder and choose ‚ÄúAdd Item‚Äù, then choose ‚ÄúDimension‚Äù from the list. Provide a name for the Key Field. The Key Field specifies the name of the column at the leaf (lowest) level of the wide table. Enable support for multiple languages If you want to enable the dimension to support different languages for displaying members, select one or more languages in the Languages dropdown. The language-specific names for each dimension member are managed in the Dimension Editor. Primary Dimension Specifying a dimension as a Primary Dimension means that it appears in the list of \"primary dimensions\" in the Dimension Editor without users first having to select a specific Solution. That gives Power users a central repository of dimensions they can edit and publish to Work Process Versions or other solutions. Think of primary dimensions as a central repository of dimensions that can be modified and published into production. Properties Dimension members can have zero or more properties. For example, products in a Product dimension can have properties such as weight, height, color, etc. Each property is materialized as a column in the dimension table. Property Id This is the Id of the property field and the name of the column in the dimension table in the database. Name Name specifies the label of the property in the Dimension Editor user interface. You can also provide specific translations for the label using this field. Data type Specifies the data type of the property. Is Lookup Use this feature if you want users to select from a set of predefined values when setting the value of the property. Extension properties Extension properties enable partners and customers to extend dimensions in installed Packages (for example, Planner) with custom properties. That makes it possible to use standard dimensions for custom Power BI reporting or EPM custom extensions. Custom properties will not be removed when the dimension is upgraded during a Package upgrade. Level names By default, column names for all levels except the leaf level are auto-generated using the format L[level number], for example, L1, L2. If you want to override the naming for each level column, you can specify this in the Level Names list. Options / Empty member If you need the dimension to always contain an empty member, enable the Include Empty Member option. This option is typically used when you are using the dimension as a source for a dropdown in a spreadsheet, and users must be able to select a ‚Äúnull‚Äù or ‚Äúnot applicable‚Äù value. Options / Dimension Composition Go to Dimension Composition. Build the dimension and edit dimension data To build the dimension and edit data, you need to use the Dimension Editor in a Workbook. In the Designer, check the ‚ÄúPrimary Dimension‚Äù in the toolbar. That will make the dimension appear in the Primary dimensions dropdown in the Workbook Dimension Editor. Create a new Workbook. In the Toolbox, choose the Resources tab and drag/drop the Dimension Editor onto a page. Open the Workbook and choose a dimension from the list of available ones. Adding members to a dimension using the tree editor To add a new root dimension member, click the ‚Äú+‚Äù button at the top of the dimension tree To add a new member as a child of another member, choose ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù from the action menu of an existing item (hover the item to make the menu trigger appear). Adding members to a dimension by importing from clipboard/Excel To import multiple members at the same time, click the Import button at the top of the dimension tree. This will display a table editor that lets you copy/paste data from Excel (or any other tab-delimited file). Note that you need to use Ctrl-V to paste into the table. You cannot right-click a cell in the table editor. Organizing dimension members To organize dimension members in a hierarchical structure, you can do the following: Drag/drop nodes between levels. Use the action menu which appears when you hover a node to add, delete, cut, paste, and clone members. To move multiple items, hold down the Ctrl key while selecting multiple members. Then use the ‚ÄúCut‚Äù and ‚ÄúPaste‚Äù options in the action menu to move the items as children to a different member. To sort children of an item, open the action menu and choose one of the sorting options available. The sorting options are only available on items in the tree which have children. Edit data in table mode You can edit properties and dimension member names (including translations) using Table Edit mode. That enables users to quickly edit data for multiple dimension members using data grid functionality like drag-copy of cells and copy/paste. While in Table Edit mode, you cannot edit the tree in any way, and you cannot switch back to the Properties tab until you have saved any changes. Note * When you are in Table Edit mode, you must remember to save your changes before choosing a different dimension member from the tree, or else all your changes are lost.* Preview dimension in different languages If you want to preview how the dimension looks in different languages, use the ‚ÄúGlobe‚Äù icon at the top of the dimension tree to switch between different languages you have enabled for the dimension. Publishing a dimension The changes you make in the Dimension Editor are not fully applied until you have published the changes. That means that you can edit the data and hierarchy, save it, and continue working until you are satisfied with the result. Before applying those changes to the actual data model used by Data Stores, Filters, Tables, etc. When you publish a dimension, it will always be published to the Solution which owns it. Additionally, you can optionally choose to publish the dimension to other Solutions and Work Process Versions as well. When you choose Solutions and/or Work Process Versions to publish to, the dimension will be published to dimensions in the target Solutions and Work Process Versions having the same name as the dimension being published.

All Solution Objects are uniquely identified by metadata ids, not the display names. When executing system tasks, InVision expects the metadata id of the objects to be passed as arguments, so you can use this directive to make InVision resolve the Id for you by specifying the name of the Solution Object. Example @Object[Sales].Id // returns the metadata if of the Solution Object 'Sales'. @Object[name[,object type]].DbObjectName Gets the actual database object name of a Solution Object (applicable to Dimensions, Facts, Data Stores, Settings and Views). You can use this directive in SQL queries and argument lists whenever you need to get the database name of a Solution Object.

Using this feature, you can create repositories which can be queried by other components of the Solution. Row Key Expression The Row Key Expression defines the key used for searching the repository. The Row Key Expression can be defined with or without curly brackets ( \"{\" and \"}\" ). You can skip the curly brackets if all the search columns are character based. If you are searching using a numeric or date column, you need to use curly brackets. Searching character based columns Searching a single column: @Object[<Name>].Lookup[KeyID:KeyValue][ValueColumn] Searching multiple columns: @Object[<Name>].Lookup[KeyID:KeyValue, KeyID2:KeyValue2,...][ValueColumn] Example This example shows how to use a Setting table as a Solution registry for common settings, and query the table in order to perform some task, which in this case is to execute a stored procedure. SlnRegistry (registry) Key Value ActivePeriod 20140101 Update External System proc_UpdateExtSysAndSendMail EXEC @Object[SlnRegistry].Lookup[**Key**:Update External System][**Value**] translates to EXEC proc_UpdateExtSysAndSendMail Searching characther and non characther based columns Searching a single column: @Object[<name>].Lookup[{ KeyID,KeyValue }][ValueColumn] Searching multiple columns: @Object[<name>].Lookup[{ KeyID:KeyValue, KeyID2:KeyValue2,... }][ValueColumn] When the columns used in the search criteria are not charachter based (nvarchar, varchar, etc), the Row Key Expression must be defined as a JSON object. Examples The AccountID column has a charachter based data type. @Object[<name>].Lookup[{ \"AccountID\":\"2000\" }][AccountName] The Amount column has a numeric data type. @Object[<name>].Lookup[{ \"Amount\":2000 }][AccountName] The BitField column is of data type bit. @Object[<name>].Lookup[{ \"BitField\":true }][BitFieldValue] @Object[name[,object type]].Column[name].TimeFrameDateExpr Gets the prepared SQL expression that calculates the date of a Time Frame column.

    "keywords": "Filters are components used for setting the data context for Settings, Worksheets, Reports, Workflows, and Data Flows. Once a Filter is defined, it can be used by all data context-aware components in a Solution by binding the Filter to a property of the component. A Filter is defined as a reference to table resource (Dimension, Fact, Setting, Data Store, or a View) and by a configuration describing how to read data from the table resource. Creating a Filter Filters are contained in Filter Collections and can be created from Data Stores, Settings, Dimensions, and Views. To create a Filter, you first need a Filter Container. Filter Containers are added to the Solution from the Solution Explorer and can contain any number of Filters. To create a Filter, open a Filter Container and drag a table resource from the Toolbox to the All Filters list. When the filter is created, it is given a default name. You need to make sure that the name of the filter is unique within the Solution (filters). When using a Dimension as the table resource, you can choose between \"Filter by Hierarchy\" a \"Filter by Column\" as the Filter Mode (see description below). Non-dimension table resources only allow the \"Filter By Column\" Filter Mode. Filter Properties Filter Name When a filter is created, it is given a default name. You need to make sure that the name is unique within the Solution (filters). Description Description field for the filter. Only used for dev/doc purposes. Filter Mode Filter by Hierarchy Only available for Dimension based filters. Specifies that the dimension hierarchy information is used to render the filter and to set the data context of the filter consumers (Worksheets, Reports, Settings, etc). Filter by Column Available for any filter type. Specifies that a specific column is used for setting the data context of the filter consumers. Using this mode, the filter cannot be rendered as a tree structure even though the underlying resource is a Dimension. Custom Text Search Index Enables text search when the filter rendering type is set to SearchBox in the Workbook filter configuration editor. When enabling this property, you need to specify the Text Search Column property. The Text Search Column of the table resource should contain the text used for matching the user search criteria. Data Id Column If the Filter Mode is Filter by Hierarchy, this property is automatically set and cannot be changed. When setting Filter Mode to Filter by Column, you need to specify which column in the table resource contains the values to filter by. Hierarchy Available only for Dimension based filters, this property specifies which hierarchy to use when rendering and setting the data context for consumers of the filter. Order Available for Dimension based filters. This property specifies whether to apply no sorting or sort by the id or display value. None - No order is applied Default ‚Äì Uses the attribute sort type to determine whether to sort by Key or Name (display value) OrderById ‚Äì Orders by the dimension attribute key of the level OrderByDescription ‚Äì Orders by the dimension attribute display value of the level (takes the selected language into account) Description Column Available only if Filter Mode is set to Filter by Column, this property specifies which column from the table resource to display when rendering the filter items. If you enable Localize Description, InVision looks for a column named <description column>_<languagecode> (for example ProductID_Name_EN) and if found, will use the values from that column to display the filter items. Localize Description Available only if Filter Mode is set to Filter by Column, this property specifies that InVision should look for a column named <description column>_<languagecode> (for example ProductID_Name_EN) and if found, will use the values from that column to display the filter items. Text Search Column Available when the Custom Text Search Index is enabled, this property specifies the column of the table resource containing the text used for matching the user search criteria. Order By Clause A SQL expression used as the ORDER BY clause to order the filter items displayed to the user. This option is only available for Flat filters. You need to type the actual Order By expression, not only the column name, for example, ORDER BY ItemID. Slice Expression A SQL expression used in a WHERE clause to limit the filter items displayed to the user. If you use custom parameters in the slice expression, the following rules apply when the filter is used in a Workbook context: You have to specify the parameter values in the LoadData action using the SetParamValue(‚Ä¶) function. On subsequent filter record requests to the database, the values resolved in the LoadData action are resent, except when the SetFilterValue action is invoked. If you use the SetFilterValue action, you need to specify the parameter values using the SetParamValue(‚Ä¶) function. Any values resolved during the LoadData action are ignored. Auto Complete filters do not support custom parameters in the slice expression. Dynamic Slice Expressions Sometimes you need to apply different types of business logic based on which level in hierarchical filters are expanded, for example, you need to filter on different attributes/columns based on which level is being expanded. **@LoadLevel** ‚Äì This system provided parameter specifies which level is being loaded (expanded) Example The following Slice Expression applies a specific business logic for level 1 ProjectStatusID = CASE WHEN @LoadLevel = 1 THEN 'N' ELSE ProjectStatusID END Default Value Expression A SQL snippet used in a WHERE clause to resolve the initially selected value of the filter when it‚Äôs rendered. If the Filter Mode is \"Filter by Hierarchy\" and there is a default member specified for the dimension as part of the Data Access permissions, the Data Access permission wins.

Form Elements are first configured in the Solution and then added to Workbooks where the user interaction can take place. Form Elements are stored in Form Element Collections, which is the only function of Form Element Collections. The reason for storing Form Elements in collections instead of the main Solution structure is that since a Form Element can only manage a single value, you can end up getting many Form Elements in a Solution that clutters up your Solution structure. To create a Form Element, open (or create) a Form Element Collection and drag a Form Element Template from the Toolbox to the designer. Once a Form Element has been created, you cannot change the type, so you need to make sure to select the right template when first creating it. To enable loading and saving data, you need to specify Data Queries.

You only need to use this feature if you need to refresh the binding target(s) regardless of whether the binding source was modified or not. An example of this is that you have multiple dropdowns data-bound to the same source, but you are using a filter function to show different subsets of the source in each dropdown. If you change the selection in one dropdown, you want the available options in the second dropdown to change. Data Bindings API Example <Function Name=\"foo\"> for(let binding of this.dataBindings.getBindings(this.lists.Customers)){ if(binding.targetName !== 'bar'){ binding.updateTarget(); } } </Function> Functions All functions in the Form Runtime can be called through the this or functions reference. The coding language is JavaScript. raiseCustomEvent(eventPayload : object) RaiseCustomEvent(eventPayload : object) Raises the Custom Event of the Form Schema with a payload, so that you can execute other Workbook Actions. Example: this.raiseCustomEvent({ message: \"Hello World \" }); AddViewStateModel(modelName : string, data : object) addViewStateModel(modelName : string, data : object) In order for change notification (DataChangeEventHandler) to work, objects must be observable. By default, JavaScript objects are not observable, so you will not get notified when they are updated. Use the AddViewStateModel(‚Ä¶) function to create an observable JavaScript Object. Example <EventHandlers> <FormEventHandler On=\"Init\"> this.addViewStateModel(\"ButtonModel\", { IsDisabled : true }); </FormEventHandler> <DataChangedEventHandler Value=\"{Binding Path:*.*}\"> this.ViewState.ButtonModel.IsDisabled = !this.ViewState.ButtonModel.IsDisabled; </DataChangedEventHandler> </EventHandlers> //Bind to ViewState Model <Button Disabled=\"{Binding Path:ViewState.ButtonModel.IsDisabled}\"/> isNumber(value : any) IsNumber(value : any) Checks if a value is a number. isDate(value : any) IsDate(value : any) Checks if a value is a Date object. startsWith(input : string, pattern : string, ignoreCase? : boolean = false) StartsWith(input : string, pattern : string, ignoreCase? : boolean = false) Checks if the input string starts with the pattern. Example const startsWithA = this.startsWith('def', 'a', true); *startsWithA* is false. endsWith(input : string, pattern : string, ignoreCase? : boolean = false) EndsWith(input : string, pattern : string, ignoreCase? : boolean = false) Checks if the input string ends with the pattern. convertTo(value : any, toDataType : string) ConvertTo(value : any, toDataType : string) Tries to convert value to the specified data type. If the conversion failes, an error is thrown. Example const num = this.convertTo(\"123\", \"number\"); Other: convertToDate(value : any, inputFormat? : string, throwOnNull? : boolean = false) ConvertToDate(value : any, inputFormat? : string, throwOnNull? : boolean = false) round(num : number, decimals : number) Round(num : number, decimals : number) Properties controls Controls Contains a dictionary of the UI controls in the Form Schema. Each control is wrapped in a ControlProxy, which provides an API to the underlying HTML Element. The controls can be referenced as properties by name. Controls without names cannot be accessed. Example Controls.input1.Disable(); models Models Contains a dictionary of all models in the Form Schema. A model can be referenced as a property by its name. Example Given the Form Schema has a Person model, its field values can be accessed this way const fullName = Models.Person.FirstName + \" \" + Models.Person.LastName; setModels SetModels Contains a dictionary of all Set Models in the Form Schema. texts Texts lists Lists Contains a dictionary of all lists in the Form Schema. When you have Dropdown controls which should provide different options based on some state, you can create your own arrays in the Form Runtime and bind the dropdowns to them. Example This example show how a Dropdown control can be bound to a dynamically created collection in the Form Runtime. The collection, ‚ÄúMyCustomList‚Äù, is created dynamically in an event handler from the ‚ÄúItems‚Äù list. The ItemsSource property of the Dropdown control is bound to the custom collection, so the options available to the user can be changed dynamically based on some condition. <Dropdown ItemsSource =\"{Binding Path:MyCustomList}\" SelectedValue =\"{BindingPath:FormData.Numeric}\" DisplayMember=\"ID\" ValueMember=\"Numeric\"/> this.MyCustomList = this.lists.Items.filter(function(item) {return item.Numeric >= 300;}); AppVariables Gives access to reading and writing Workbook variables. Example models.Customer.ChangedBy = AppVariables.getValue(\"SYS\").CurrentUserName; Disabled Use the Disable property to disable a control or set it to read-only. The disabled property support data binding or an explicit value (true, false). Example <Button Disabled=\"{Binding Path:Customer.NotActive}\"/> or <Button Disabled=\"true\"/> You cannot use both a Binding AND the control APIs at the same time to set the disabled state of a control. If the Disabled property of a control has a Binding, using the control.Disable() or control.Enable() APIs will not work (binding will win). Valid values for the Disabled property: True False {Binding} Custom models If you need to maintain state for data that does not come from the database, you can create a custom model using the addViewStateModel(...) API. This creates an in-memory object that you can use to store state which also supports data binding. You can access the custom model through the ViewState API. <FormEventHandler On=\"Init\"> this.addViewStateModel(\"MyModel\", { labelText : 'Hello world' }); </FormEventHandler> Example <Form> <Style> <Layouts> <Grid Name=\"grid\" Rows=\"auto auto 1fr\" Columns=\"auto auto 1fr\" /> </Layouts> </Style> <Texts /> <Data> <Models /> <Lists /> <SetModels /> </Data> <Functions> <Function Name=\"UpdateLabelText\"> this.ViewState.MyModel.labelText = \"Foo bar baz\"; </Function> </Functions> <EventHandlers> <FormEventHandler On=\"Init\"> this.addViewStateModel(\"MyModel\", { labelText : 'Hello world' }); </FormEventHandler> </EventHandlers> <UI Grid=\"grid\"> <Label Text=\"{Binding Path:ViewState.MyModel.labelText}\"/> </UI> </Form>"

    "keywords": "Inherits from Control. TreeView presents a hierarchical view of information, where each item can have zero or more children / subitems. Properties ItemsSource This is the collection of items displayed in the TreeView. The ItemSource can be a SetModel, List, or DimensionModel. If the ItemsSource is a SetModel or List, you must set the ItemId and ParentItemId to specify the parent-child relationship between the items in the TreeView. If the ItemsSource is a DimensionModel, you should NOT specify the ItemId, ParentItemId, or DisplayMember. ItemId Specify the name of the field in the ItemSource that represents an item. If the ItemSource is a SetModel or List, you must set the ItemId. If the ItemSource is a DimensionModel, this property is ignored. ParentItemId Specifies the name of the field in the ItemSource that represents the parent of an item. If the ItemSource is a SetModel or List, you must set the ParentItemId. If the ItemsSource is a DimensionModel, this property is ignored. DisplayMember Specifies the name of the field in the ItemSource that should be displayed as the text of an item in the TreeView. If this field is not specified, the ItemId field is displayed in the tree. If the ItemsSource is a DimensionModel, this property is ignored. CanSelectItem The callback function which returns true or false, indicating whether an item in the TreeView can be selected by the user. The argument passed to the function is the data object from the ItemsSource displayed in the TreeView. ItemSelected The function to call when an item in the TreeView is selected. The argument passed to the function is the data object from the ItemsSource displayed in the TreeView which is being clicked / selected by the user. ItemTemplate Use ItemTemplate to specify the custom rendering of TreeView items, for example, if you want to render images or checkboxes. Basic example using SetModel as ItemsSource The example below shows how to use a SetModel as a data source for a TreeView. The ItemID and ParentItemID fields from the source table specifies the parent/child relationship, and the ItemName specifies the label displayed for each node in the tree. They are mapped to the TreeView ItemId, ParentItemId, and DisplayMember properties, respectively. In this case, they happen to have similar names, but that is coincidental. The fields from the data source could have been Foo, Bar, Baz, and you would have to map them to the TreeView properties the same way. <Form> <Style> <Layouts> <Grid Name=\"grid\" Rows=\"1fr\" Columns=\"1fr\" /> </Layouts> <Css> .border{ border: 1px solid var(--theme-border-color); } </Css> </Style> <Data> <SetModels> <SetModel Name=\"TreeViewData\" Source=\"Setting_HierarchicalTable_11022021184313\" Fields=\"ItemID, ItemName, ParentItemID, SomeBool, VotingDisabled\"/> </SetModels> </Data> <Functions> <Function Name=\"onItemSelected\" Parameters=\"item\"> alert('You selected ' + item.ItemName); </Function> <Function Name=\"onItemClick\" Parameters=\"item\"> alert('You clicked ' + item.ItemName); </Function> <Function Name=\"onCanSelectItem\" Parameters=\"item\"> // Only allow selecting items which are children of items with Id 'Root' return item.ParentItemID === 'Root'; </Function> </Functions> <EventHandlers/> <UI Grid=\"grid\"> <Grid Rows=\"1fr\" Columns=\"1fr\"> <TreeView ItemsSource=\"{Binding Path:TreeViewData}\" Row=\"1\" Column=\"1\" ItemId=\"ItemID\" ParentItemId=\"ParentItemID\" DisplayMember=\"ItemName\" ItemSelected=\"onItemSelected\" CanSelectItem=\"onCanSelectItem\" CssClass=\"border\"/> </Grid> </UI> </Form> Example using ItemTemplate The example below show how to use the ItemTemplate to provide a custom rendering of items in the TreeView. Note The use of the special $Data argument passed when calling the onItemClick function in the Button Click event handler. The $Data argument represents the data object from the ItemsSource displayed by the clicked TreeView item. The data context for bindings inside the ItemTemplate is the data object being rendered, meaning that Binding Path:ItemName binds the Text of the Label to the ItemName property of the data object rendered by the TreeView item. You need to bind to something outside the item, you need to use the full path of the property, including the model name, for example {Binding Path:Models.Customer.Name} <TreeView ItemsSource=\"{Binding Path:TreeViewData}\" Row=\"1\" Column=\"1\" ItemId=\"ItemID\" ParentItemId=\"ParentItemID\" DisplayMember=\"ItemName\" ItemSelected=\"onItemSelected\" CanSelectItem=\"onCanSelectItem\" CssClass=\"border\"> <ItemTemplate> <Layout Grid=\"grid\"> <Grid Columns=\"auto auto auto\" Gap=\"4px\"> <Input Type=\"checkbox\" VerticalAlignment=\"center\" Value=\"{Binding Path:SomeBool}\" /> <Label Text=\"{Binding Path:ItemName}\" VerticalAlignment=\"center\" Column=\"2\"/> <Button Click=\"onItemClick($Data)\" Text=\"Vote!\" StopClickEventPropagation=\"true\" Column=\"4\" Type=\"Link\" Disabled=\"{Binding Path:VotingDisabled}\" /> </Grid> </Layout> </ItemTemplate> </TreeView> Example using DimensionModel as ItemsSource When using a dimension as ItemsSource, you should not specify the ItemId, ParentItemId, and DisplayMember properties. The system will take care of rendering the TreeView correctly without any configuration as long as the ItemsSource is bound to a DimensionModel. A DimensionModel must have a Name and a Source. The Name is the name of the model, that you bind to the TreeView. The Source is the name of the dimension in your Solution. It is NOT the database table name of the dimension. Also, you cannot use the @Object[‚Ä¶].DbObjectName directive as Source. Note! that you cannot use legacy Wide or Linked dimensions as sources for DimensionModels. <Form> <Style> <Layouts> <Grid Name=\"grid\" Rows=\"1fr\" Columns=\"1fr\" /> </Layouts> </Style> <Texts /> <Data> <Dimensions> <DimensionModel Name=\"TreeViewData\" Source=\"PCDim\"/> </Dimensions> </Data> <EventHandlers/> <UI Grid=\"grid\"> <Grid Rows=\"1fr\" Columns=\"1fr\"> <TreeView ItemsSource=\"{Binding Path:TreeViewData}\" Row=\"1\" Column=\"1\" /> </Grid> </UI> </Form> Videos Form Schemas TreeView"

Set Models are similar to Lists, except their contents can be modified and saved back to the database. Set Models represents a collection of objects which is read from the database, can be modified in the user interface, and then saved back to the database. You would typically use a Set Model for displaying and editing data in a Listbox. Models represent the data objects which are loaded from the database, displayed or modified by the user through the user interface, and then saved back to the database. A Form Schema can have many Models. A (data) Model represents a single object instance, and contains one or more fields that are read from the database, either from a table, view or custom query. Each field can be data bound to form controls for displaying or modifying data. If you read the Model from a view or custom query, you need to provide a custom SQL expression to save changes back to the database. Dimension Models are data sources for controls that can display data in a hierarchical view, for example, the TreeView control. Dimension Models are read-only and cannot be modified and saved back to the database.

Dimension Models are read-only and cannot be modified and saved back to the database. Properties: Name The name of the model. The Name is required and used by controls to specify its data source. Source The name of the dimension. Unlike Lists, SetModels and Models, you cannot specify the database table name or use the @Object[‚Ä¶].DbObjectName directive to specify the source dimension. AccessControl[Optional] If you want to enable access control to dimensions displayed in Forms, use one of the following options: None - No access control is applied. The user will see every dimension member. This is the default Standard - Users only see the dimension members that they have access to. Custom - The API returns every member of the dimension with a property describing the access level granted for each item. It is up to the solution developer to decide how to enforce access control when rendering the UI (for example hiding or making an item non-selectable). The default name of the access level property is 'AccessLevel'. If you want a different name, for example if you dimension has a custom property alrady called 'AccessLevel', use the CustomAccessControlProperty property to specify a different access level property name. AccessLevel values: 0 = User has no access to the dimension member 1 = Read (Currently not supported. Reserved for future use) 2 = Write CustomAccessControlProperty[Optional] The default name of the property to programatically check for access level is 'AccessLevel'. If you want a different name, for example if you dimension has a custom property alrady called 'AccessLevel', use the CustomAccessControlProperty property to specify a different access level property name.

FormEventHandlers is executed when a form event is raised, for example when data has been loaded or when the form has initialized. DataChangedEventHandlers are bound to fields in Models and executes when fields change. Event handlers contains plain JavaScript, which is executed every time an event handler runs. In event handlers and functions, you can access the Form Runtime and Control APIs that lets you call methods on controls, do validation, do calculations, raise Workbook events and more. FormEventHandler FormEventHandlers contains JavaScript code, and you can access the Form Runtime and Control APIs that lets you call methods on controls, do validation, do calculations, raise Workbook events and more. FormEventHandler is executed when a form event is raised. There are currently two form events. Init The Init event runs after the first render of the Form Schema. Rendering happens the first time it appears on the screen and after data has been loaded. <EventHandlers> <FormEventHandler On=\"Init\"> <![CDATA[ // Your JavaScript goes here ]] </FormEventHandler> </EventHandlers> Example The following event handler runs when the Init event is raised. <FormEventHandler On=\"Init\"> <![CDATA[ controls.myInput.setIsEnabled(false); alert('Hello world'); ]] </FormEventHandler> DataLoaded The DataLoaded event runs after data has been loaded, but before the initial render. If you need to manipulate the data before it is rendered the first time, you should use this event. <EventHandlers> <FormEventHandler On=\"DataLoaded\"> <![CDATA[ // Your JavaScript goes here ]] </FormEventHandler> </EventHandlers> Example The following event handler runs when the DataLoaded event is raised. <FormEventHandler On=\"DataLoaded\"> <![CDATA[ this.models.Customer.Name = 'Customer 2'; ]] </FormEventHandler> Unload The Unload event is raised when the Form Schema is unloaded from the DOM. You can use this event to unsubscribe from events raised from DOM nodes outside the Form, or do other types of cleanup. Example <EventHandlers> <FormEventHandler On=\"Unload\"> // unsubscribe events, cleanup, etc window.removeEventListener('click', ...); </FormEventHandler> </EventHandlers> DataChangedEventHandler DataChangedEventHandlers are bound to properties in Models, and executes when fields change. DataChangeEventHandlers can listen for changes to a specific property, or to all properties in a Model. <DataChangedEventHandler Value=\"{Binding Path:FormData.Bit}\"> <![CDATA[ // Your JavaScript goes here // The following variables are available in the scope // $model, $modelName, $propertyName, $newValue, $oldValue); ]] </DataChangedEventHandler> The DataChangeEventHandler has the following parameters, which can be accessed by your code. Parameter Description $model This is the model object that the event handler is listening for changes to. $modelName This is the name of the Model that the event handler is listening for changes to. $propertyName This is the name of the property in the model that changed. $newValue This is the new value of the property being listened to. $oldValue This is the old value of the property being listened to. Listening for changes To listen for changes, you need to set the Value property of the DataChangedEventHandler, and specify a binding to the property or properties of the Model that you want to monitor. To listen for changes to a specific property, use Value=‚Äù{Binding Path:ModelName.PropertyName}‚Äù. To listen for changes to any property of a model, use Value=‚Äù{Binding Path:ModelName.*}‚Äù Example This example show how a DataChangedEventHandler can listen for changes to the Name property of the customer Model. When Name changes, the code below is executed. <DataChangedEventHandler Value=\"{Binding Path:Customer.Name}\"> <![CDATA[ // call shared function var isValidName = this.isValidName($newValue); controls.Input1.setIsEnabled(isValidName); controls.Btn_Notify.setIsEnabled(isValidName); ]] </DataChangedEventHandler> Example This example show how a DataChangedEventHandler can listen for changes to all properties of the Customer model. By examining the $propertyName, we determine which validation to run. ValidateName(‚Ä¶) and ValidateEmail(‚Ä¶) are functions defined in the Functions section. <DataChangedEventHandler Value=\"{Binding Path:Customer.*}\"> <![CDATA[ // The following variables are available in the scope of a DataChangedEventHandler // $model, $modelName, $propertyName, $newValue, $oldValue); if($propertyName === \"Name\"){ functions.ValidateName($newValue); } else if($propertyName === \"Email\"){ functions.ValidateEmail($newValue); } ]] </DataChangedEventHandler>"

You can even define your entire SQL query using just macros. To add a macro to a SQL query, use the {{ and }} tokens to indicate the beginning and end of a macro, for example **{{MyWhereClause(@ProductID)}}**, where MyWhereClause is a macro that takes one argument. The example below shows how to dynamically construct a SQL query using macros. As you can see, we‚Äôre using both Function and Non-Function macros (macros that can take arguments, and those that can‚Äôt). SELECT {{ColumnNames}} FROM @Object[WebApp Basic Store,DataStore].DbObjectName WHERE {{WhereClause}} AND {{FilterOnQuantity(10)}} {{OrderByAsync()}} There are 4 macros here ‚Äì ColumnNames, WhereClause, FilterOnQuantity and OrderByAsync. ColumnNames and WhereClause are Non-Function macros (they do not have a parameter list), while FilterOnQuantity and OrderByAsync are function macros (they do have a parameter list). Non-function and Function macros does not differ in where they can be used, but how they can be used and how they are implemented. The code below shows the core concepts of how these macros can be implemented. Notice how the method names of the Function macros match the names of macros in the SQL expression and that they return a string. Also, regard that the expansions for the Non-Function macros are resolved in the RunAsync method. namespace Local { using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Profitbase.Invision.Scripting.Dynamic; public class MacroRuntime : MacroExpansionProvider { public override async Task<IEnumerable<Expansion>> RunAsync() { var list = new List<Expansion>(); list.Add(new Expansion(\"WhereClause\", \"Qty > 2\")); // Expansion of the WhereClause macro var columnNames = await ObjectModel.ForObject(\"WebApp Basic Store\").Storage().GetColumnNamesAsync(); list.Add(new Expansion(\"ColumnNames\", string.Join(\",\", columnNames))); // Expansion of the ColumnNames macro return list; } // Expansion of the FilterOnQuery macro public string FilterOnQuantity(int num) { return $\"Qty < {num}\"; } // Expansion of the OrderByAsync macro public Task<string> OrderByAsync() { return Task.FromResult(\"ORDER BY AccountID\"); } } }"

An Expansion object must contain the macro name and the expansion itself (the value that the macro produces) Because Non-Function macros cannot accept arguments, they will always produce the same result, so you cannot use them multiple places in the same query unless you want the same SQL expression to be inserted at the different locations.

For example, for macros in a SQL Script, the current execution context of the macros is the invocation of the SQL Script. The Context has the following APIs Properties: ObjectId : string The Id of the object in the current execution context, for example the Object Id of a SQL Script or Report. SolutionId : string The ID of the solution in the current execution context, for example the id of the solution of the SQL Script being executed. IsDevMode : boolean Indicates whether the execution context is being invoked from the Designer or not. Arguments : ArgumentsProvider Provides access to read the arguments passed in to the execution context, for example the arguments passed by SetParamValue(‚Ä¶) when executing a SQL Script of loading data to a SQL Report. CustomArguments : ArgumentsList Provides an API for creating custom arguments from within macros. When generating parameterized SQL expressions, it is best practice to use query parameters instead of coding the values into the expressions. You can use the CustomArguments list to register query parameters from within your macro. UserId : string The id of the currently logged-in user, for example, user@corp.com. GetUserUniqueId() : string Returns the ID of the user account of the currently logged in user. If Azure AD is used as the identity provider, this is the OID (GUID) coming from Azure AD. If Windows AD is used, the ID is the SID. LanguageCode : string The culture name in the format languagecode2-country/regioncode2, for example, EN-US. Note This property usually just returns a two-letter language code (for example EN), because InVision is usually set up to use two-letter cultures codes. TwoLetterLanguageCode : string The ISO 639-1 two letter language code, for example, EN. The ArgumentsProvider has the following APIs bool TryGetValue<T>(string name, out T value) bool TryGetValue(string name, out object value) T GetValue<T>(string name) object GetValue(string name) bool Contains(string name) The following example shows how the Context API can be used to create the ConditionalWhere macro. namespace Local { using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Profitbase.Invision.Scripting.Dynamic; public class MyMacros : MacroExpansionProvider { public string ConditionalWhere(string tableAlias) { if(this.Context.IsDevMode) { return \"WHERE 1 = 1\"; } else { if(this.Context.Arguments.TryGetValue<int>(\"@Level\", out int level)) { // @SelectedProductId is passed as argument to the execution context // for example by SetParamValue(...). // If it is not, provide a default value if(!this.Context.Arguments.Contains(\"@SelectedProductId\")) { this.Context.CustomArguments.Add(\"@SelectedProductId\", \"myDummyValue\"); } switch(level) { case 1: return $\"WHERE {tableAlias}.L1 = @SelectedProductId\"; case 2: return $\"WHERE {tableAlias}.L2 = @SelectedProductId\"; default: return $\"WHERE {tableAlias}.LEAF = @SelectedProductId\"; } } else { return \"WHERE 1 = 2\"; } } } } }"

    "keywords": "Define Package When defining a Package, you should consider all the following points. Version Package Type Post Deployment Action Package data Package Properties Work Process integration a. Data Flows b. Upgrade Scripts Dependencies 1. Version If you want to make the Package deployable and upgradable, you need to bump the version before making an official release. To make an official release of the Package, press the ‚ÄúCreate Package‚Äù button in the toolbar and choose ‚ÄúRelease‚Äù as Deployment mode. 2. Package Type You should always specify the Package Type, making it easy for users to find and upgrade packages using the Package Management screen. Specifying the Package Type does not have any other impact than making it easier for users to find what they're looking for (Products or Libraries) when deploying or upgrading packages. 3. Define Package Documentation link: You can specify the Package Documentation link, making it easy for users to find useful informations. 4. Post Deployment Action If you need to run a Data Flow after a Package has been deployed to do some initialization or any other type of work, specify the Data Flow you want to run as the Post Deployment Action. The Data Flow will run as the last step of the deployment process. 5. Package Data By default, only metadata configuration is included when exporting a Package using the Create Package button. This means that when the Package is deployed, it will not contain any information such as sample data, settings, assumptions, etc. To deploy data with the Package, you must add the relevant tables to the Package data list. This makes it much quicker for a customer to get started using your Package. 6. Package Properties Package Properties are variables that can be used by functionality within the Solution that the Package is deployed. The most common case for Package Properties is when Packages are used in Work Processes. Package Properties defines the settings for Work Process Versions that process owners can manage to configure Work Process Versions. Examples of typical Package Properties are planning period start dates and end dates. When creating Package Properties, it is essential to use a naming scheme that makes the property unique. For example, if you want a property named ‚ÄúStartDate‚Äù, and your Package is called ‚ÄúHypotesia‚Äù, you should name your property ‚ÄúHypotesia.StartDate‚Äù. It needs to be unique, because different packages can be deployed to the same Solution, and the scope of a Package Property is the Solution, not the Package. The reason for the scope being the Solution and not the Package is that Package Properties also serve as interfaces between Packages. 7. Work Process Integration Work Process integration ‚Äì Data Flows When a Package is used in Work Processes, such as budgeting and forecasting, you often need to run business logic when the Work Process Version transitions between states (Deployed, Open, Closed, Deleted). Under the Work Process tab, you can specify Data Flows to run after Work Process Versions containing this Package have entered the Deployed, Open, Closed, or Deleted state. Work Process integration ‚Äì Upgrade Scripts Because Work Process Versions are isolated from each other, you can have different versions of the same Package in different Work Process Versions. However, if you upgrade a Package to a new version, and you create a new Work Process Version containing the new version of the Package but want to pull in data from a Work Process Version using an older version of the Package, you may get in trouble because the old version is missing data that the new version of the Package requires. To fix this issue, you must provide a set of SQL scripts which acts as adapters between old and newer versions of a Package. To use this feature, do the following: As a direct child of the Package, create a folder named UPDATE_SCRIPTS In the UPDATE_SCRIPTS folder, create one or more SQL Scripts to execute. The following applies for the scripts: The scripts are executed after a Work Process Version containing the Package has been deployed. They are executed in the order they listed in the folder. SQL parameters @FromVersion and @ToVersion are passed to the scripts when executed. @FromVersion specifies the version of the Package in the source Work Process Version. @ToVersion specifies the version of the current Package. 8. Dependencies If a Package is dependent upon another Package, you need to add the dependency to the ‚ÄúPackage Dependencies‚Äù list. By defining dependencies, the system will automatically install or update dependencies when the Package itself is installed or updated to new versions. Note You need to register immediate dependencies, meaning you don‚Äôt need to register dependencies of dependencies. When exporting the Package, the system will automatically examine all dependencies and their dependencies, recursively. Videos Packages Define Package"

It also contains code that will be used by the Excel Functions script. Excel Functions uses Pb. 'Excel Impl' to enable use of the Import-ExcelData function inside Excel Impl Finally We use Pb. Excel Functions to enable use of the PbImport-Excel function inside the Excel Functions. Example 2 Embed SQL Script We have a SQL Script called Sql w macro. It has a macro defined.

    "title": "SQL Reports | Profitbase Docs",
    "keywords": "InVision supports line and chart reports, and a single report can toggle between line and chart display mode. Reports are created by defining one or more data sets using SQL queries and then mapping those data sets to chart and table reports. InVision reports can read data from any SQL source, so you can use reports to view data from any SQL Server database in addition to the InVision databases. Query Definitions The data sets for the line and chart reports are created using standard SQL queries and SQL direktives, called Data Queries. A Report definition can contain multiple data sets used for displaying the same data in different ways. For example, you can use one data set for the chart and a different data set for the line report. Or you can use multiple data sets in the same chart and display then as different series. The data sets are listed in the Data Sets list of the Report editor. To create a new data set, drag and drop a \"New Default Data Set\" from the Data View Resources Toolbox onto the list. Default queries for reading data from InVision table resources such as Data Stores and Views can be added by drag and drop resource objects from the Database Resources Toolbox onto the query editor. Writing custom event handlers for Chart events Profitbase InVision is using Highcharts for rendering charts. If you want to write custom event handlers for events such as when a user clicks a point in a series, or when the user hovers the mouse over a point, you should first read the documentation for Highcharts on how to handle the different types of events and what data is available to an event handler function when the event is raised. Currently, InVision has a built-in event handler that can be applied to the Point Clicked event of a series. When the user clicks a point, the ChartInteractionEvent will be raised when the Report is displayed in a Workbook, passing along the x-value, y-value and the data object (row) that point represents. Any other Workbook component can subscribe to this event and use the event payload to do with as he pleases. If you need to write a custom event handler for any of the events exposed by the Properties editor in the Chart Configuration screen, you can either write an inline function or provide the name of a function from a JavaScript defined in the solution. The example below shows how to create a custom event handler for the point clicked event of a series, which will raise the ChartInteractionEvent manually. It will also output the data object associated with the point to the browser console window. var mySolution; (function(mySolution){ var myChartEventHandlers; (function(myChartEventHandlers){ var myUtil = (function(){ function myUtil(){ } myUtil.onClick = function(){ console.log(this.dataObject); this.series.chart.componentContext.eventDispatcher raiseEvent('ChartInteractionEvent', {x : this.x, y : this.y, row : this.dataObject}, this.series.chart.componentContext.componentId); }; return myUtil; })(); myChartEventHandlers.myUtil = myUtil; })( myChartEventHandlers = mySolution. myChartEventHandlers || (mySolution. myChartEventHandlers = {})); })(mySolution || (mySolution = {})); To use this function as the event handler of the Point Clicked event of a Serie, enter the following value for the Point Clicked property of a chart serie: func::mySolution.myChartEventHandlers.myUtil.onClick (Note the func:: designation at the start) See Also How to's Reports Charts Formatting Data Queries Videos SQL Reports SQL Reports - Basics SQL Reports - Charts SQL Reports - ChartInteractionEvent"

    "title": "Charts Formatting | Profitbase Docs",
    "keywords": "General pie chart properties Data Source Specifies the source of the data set. Name Value Specifies the Name Value. Serie Name Specifies the name of the Series. Serie Colors A series specific or series type specyfic color set to use instead of the global colors. Data Labels Enabled Enable or disable the data labels. Data Labels Format A format string for the data label. Available variables are the same as for [ formatter ]. Data Labels Formatter Callback JavaScript function to format the data label. Note If a [ format ] is defined, the format takes precedence and the formatter is ignored. Available data are: [ this.centage ] Stacked series and pies only. The point's percentage of the total. [ this.point ] The point object. The point name, if defined, is available through [ this.point.name ]. [ this.series ]: The series object. The series name is available through [ this.series.name ]. [ this.total ] Stacked series only. The total value at this point's x value. [ this.x ] The x value. [ this.y ] The y value. Tooltip Point Format The HTML of the point's line in the tooltip. Variables are enclosed by curly brackets. Available variables are point.x, point.y, series.name and series.color and other properties on the same form. Furthermore, point.y can be extended by the [ tooltip.yPrefix ] and [ tooltip.ySuffix ] variables. This can also be overridden for each series, which makes it a good hook for displaying units. Tooltip Point Formatter A callback function for formatting the HTML output for a single point in the tooltip. Like the pointFormat string, but with more flexibility. The [this] keyword refers to the Point object. Tooltip Date Time Label Formats For series on a datetime axes, the date format in the tooltip's header will by default be guessed based on the closest data points. This member gives the default string representations used for each unit. For an overview of the replacement codes, see <a href=#Highcharts.dateFormat>dateFormat</a>. Defaults to: { millisecond:%A, %b %e, %H:%M:%S.%L, second:%A, %b %e, %H:%M:%S, minute:%A, %b %e, %H:%M, hour:%A, %b %e, %H:%M, day:%A, %b %e, %Y, week:Week from %A, %b %e, %Y, month:%B %Y, year:%Y } Tooltip Value Decimals How many decimals to show in each series' y value. This is overridable in each series' tooltip options object. The default is to preserve all decimals. Tooltip XDate Format The format for the date in the tooltip header if the X axis is a datetime axis. The default is a best guess based on the smallest distance between points in the chart. X Axis When using dual or multiple x axes, this number defines which xAxis the particular series is connected to. It refers to either the <a href=#xAxis.id>axis id</a> or the index of the axis in the xAxis array, with 0 being the first. Y Axis When using dual or multiple y axes, this number defines which yAxis the particular series is connected to. It refers to either the <a href=#yAxis.id>axis id</a> or the index of the axis in the yAxis array, with 0 being the first. Data Point Factory Function name (on the form func::my.lib.func) or function expression used for creating a Data Point for a serie. An object on the form {pointData, row, serieName} is passed to the function. The pointData is the point data object already created by InVision, which you can modify in this function by changing its fields and adding new ones. The row is the actual data row from the Data Source that the pointData object was created from. The serieName is the name of the serie. Advanced pie chart properties Allow point select Allow this series' points to be selected by clicking on the markers, bars or pie slices. Animation Enable or disable the initial animation when a series is displayed. The animation can also be set as a configuration object. Note This option applies only to the initial animation of the series itself. For other animations, see <a href=#chart.animation>chart.animation</a> and the animation parameter under the API methods. The following properties are supported: <dl> <dt>duration</dt> <dd>The duration of the animation in milliseconds.</dd> <dt>easing</dt> <dd>When using jQuery as the general framework, the easing can be set to [ linear ] or [ swing ]. More easing functions are available with the use of jQuery plug-ins, most notably the jQuery UI suite. See <a href=http://api.jquery.com/animate/>the jQuery docs</a>. When using MooTools as the general framework, use the property name [ transition ] instead of [ easing ].</dd> </dl> Due to poor performance, animation is disabled in old IE browsers for column charts and polar charts. Border color The color of the border surrounding each slice. Border width The width of the border surrounding each slice. Center The center of the pie chart relative to the plot area. Can be percentages or pixel values. The default behaviour (as of 3.0) is to center the pie so that all slices and data labels are within the plot area. As a consequence, the pie may actually jump around in a chart with dynamic values, as the data labels move. In that case, the center should be explicitly set, for example to [ [50%, 50%] ]. Cursor You can set the cursor to pointer if you have click events attached to the series, to signal to the user that the points and lines can be clicked. Enable mouse tracking Enable or disable the mouse tracking for a specific series. This includes point tooltips and click events on graphs and points. For large datasets it improves performance. End angle The end angle of the pie in degrees where 0 is top and 90 is right. Defaults to [ startAngle ] plus 360. Ignore hidden point Equivalent to <a href=#chart.ignoreHiddenSeries>chart.ignoreHiddenSeries</a>, this option tells whether the series shall be redrawn as if the hidden point were [ null ]. The default value changed from [ false ] to [ true ] with Highcharts 3.0. Inner size The size of the inner diameter for the pie. A size greater than 0 renders a donut chart. Can be a percentage or pixel value. Percentages are relative to the size of the plot area. Pixel values are given as integers. Linked to The <a href=#series.id>id</a> of another series to link to. Additionally, the value can be :previous to link to the previous series. When two series are linked, only the first one appears in the legend. Toggling the visibility of this also toggles the linked series. Min size The minimum size for a pie in response to auto margins. The pie will try to shrink to make room for data labels in side the plot area, but only to this size. Selected Whether to select the series initially. If [ showCheckbox ] is true, the checkbox next to the series name will be checked for a selected series. Shadow Whether to apply a drop shadow to the plot area. Requires that plotBackgroundColor be set. Since 2.3 the shadow can be an object configuration containing [ color ], [ offsetX ], [ offsetY ], [ opacity ] and [ width ]. Show in legend Whether to display this particular series or series type in the legend. The default value is [ true ] for standalone series, [ false ] for linked series. Size The diameter of the pie relative to the plot area. Can be a percentage or pixel value. Pixel values are given as integers. The default behaviour (as of 3.0) is to scale to the plot area and give room for data labels within the plot area. As a consequence, the size of the pie may vary when points are updated and data labels more around. In that case it is best to set a fixed value, for example [ 75% ]. Sliced offset If a point is sliced, moved out from the center, how many pixels should it be moved? Start angle The start angle of the pie slices in degrees where 0 is top and 90 right. Sticky tracking Sticky tracking of mouse events. When true, the [ mouseOut ] event on a series isn't triggered until the mouse moves over another series, or out of the plot area. When false, the [ mouseOut ] event on a series is triggered when the mouse leaves the area around the series' graph or markers. This also implies the tooltip.

Defaults to true for line and area type series, but to false for columns, pies etc. Index The index of the series in the chart, affecting the internal index in the [ chart.series ] array, the visible Z index as well as the order in the legend.

    "title": "Data Queries | Profitbase Docs",
    "keywords": "Data Queries are scripts used for loading and saving data. Data Queries are written using standard T-SQL queries which can be extended using SQL Directives to enable a dynamic behavior relative to the Solution and execution context. Before a Data Query is executed, InVision scans for SQL directives and changes the query accordingly. When creating Data Queries, you can access any SQL data source by providing the connection string. When accessing InVision resources, you do not need to specify a connection string. SQL Directives SQL directives are instructions added to standard SQL expressions which are executed by InVision before sending the query to the database. Before SQL queries are executed, InVision scans for SQL directives and changes the queries accordingly. SQL directives are required when filter values or parameters are passed during execution time and when you want to refer to Solution database objects without hard coding the table or column names. Standard directives @Declare_FilterAlias(<Filter name>[,alias]) Specifies that a query uses a filter, and that filter values passed to the execution of the query will change the data set returned. The @Declare_FilterAlias statement(s) must be added at the very top of the query. @Object_Name(alias) Returns the database table name that the filter is pointing to. The alias parameter refers to the alias specified by the filter declaration. @Id_Column(alias) Returns the column name of the column specified as the ID column of a filter. The alias parameter refers to the alias specified by the filter declaration. It is recommended to use this function instead of hard coding the column name in the query because it allows you to change the filter configuration without breaking the query. @Values_Equal(alias[,mapTo]) @Values_Equal is used for dynamically creating a comparison statement in the query using the ‚ÄòIN‚Äô operator to compare the values passed as the filtering values to the filter id column or optionally to the column specified as argument number two. Note that you cannot use the mapTo parameter if the filter is set up to use Filter Mode Filter by Hierarchy and the dimension has more than one level. Example Suppose you have declared the Product filter in a query. The ID column of the Products filter is ProductID. The user selects two products from the Product filter, \"P-001\" and \"P-002\" and then executes the query. This example shows how the WHERE clause is constructed based on the filter values passed during execution. @Declare_FilterAlias(Products,p) SELECT s.ProductID,s.Qty,‚Ä¶ FROM @Object[ProductsInStore].DbObjectName s JOIN @Object_Name(p) p ON s.ProductID = p.[@Id_Column(p)] WHERE @Values_Equal(p) //The actual SQL query executed, given the table name formProductsInStore is //ProductsInStore_xyz and the table used by the Products filter is Products_xyz, //will be this one; Compiled query SELECT s.ProductID, s.Qty FROM ProductsInStore_xyz s JOIN Products_xyz p ON s.ProductID = p.[ProductID] WHERE (p.ProductID IN('P-001', 'P-002')) //Using the mapTo version of the directive will produce the following WHERE clauses: WHERE @Values_Equal(p,s.ProductID) => WHERE (s.ProductID IN('P-001','P-002')) @Values_NotEqual(alias[,mapTo]) The same as @Values_Equal(‚Ä¶), except it's being compared for inequality instead of equality. @Values_GreaterThan(alias[,mapTo,AND | OR}) @Values_GreaterThan is used for dynamically creating a comparison statement in the query using the ‚Äò>‚Äô (greater than) operator to compare the values passed as the filtering values to the filter id column or optionally to the column specified as argument number two. If more than one filter value is passed, the OR operator is applied for each comparison unless AND is passed as argument number 3. Note that you cannot use the mapTo parameter if the filter is set up to use Filter Mode Filter by Hierarchy and the dimension has more than one level. Example Suppose you have declared the Product filter in a query. The ID column of the Products filter is ProductID. The user selects two products from the Product filter, \"P-001\" and \"P-002\" and then executes the query. This example shows how the WHERE clause is constructed based on the filter values passed during execution. @Declare_FilterAlias(Products,p) SELECT s.ProductID,s.Qty,‚Ä¶ FROM @Object[ProductsInStore].DbObjectName s JOIN @Object_Name(p) p ON s.ProductID = p.[@Id_Column(p)] WHERE @Values_GreaterThan(p) //The actual SQL query executed, given the table name for //ProductsInStore is ProductsInStore_xyz and the table used by the //Products filter is Products_xyz, will be this one; Compiled query SELECT s.ProductID, s.Qty FROM ProductsInStore_xyz s JOIN Products_xyz p ON s.ProductID = p.[ProductID] WHERE (p.ProductID > 'P-001' OR p.ProductID > 'P-002') //Using the mapTo version of the directive will produce the following WHERE clauses: WHERE @Values_GreaterThan(p,s.ProductID) => WHERE (s.ProductID > 'P-001' OR s.ProductID > 'P-002') WHERE @Values_GreaterThan(p,null, AND) => WHERE (p.ProductID > 'P-001' AND s.ProductID > 'P-002') WHERE @Values_GreaterThan(p,s.ProductID, AND) => WHERE (s.ProductID > 'P-001' AND s.ProductID > 'P-002') @Values_GreaterThanOrEqual(alias[,mapTo,AND | OR]) Similar to the @Values_GreatherThan, except that comparison operator is ‚Äò>=‚Äô (greater than or equal) @Values_LessThan(alias[,mapTo,AND | OR]) Similar to the @Values_GreatherThan, except that comparison operator is ‚Äò<‚Äô (less than) @Values_LessThanOrEqual(alias[,mapTo,AND | OR]) Similar to the @Values_GreatherThan, except that comparison operator is ‚Äò<=‚Äô (less than or equal) Custom Parameters You can add custom parameters directly to queries which enables filtering without using SQL directives. Example This example shows a query using a custom parameter, @ItemID, in the WHERE clause SELECT * FROM @Object[MyTable].DbObjectName WHERE ItemID = @ItemID To pass values to custom parameters, you need to use the SetParamValue(‚Ä¶) directive when executing the query from the Workbook context.

Defining SQL Scripts You can add SQL scripts to folders and Data Stores in your Solution. Any valid T-SQL Script can be executed from InVision, and you can also use InVision Standard Directives to more easily address objects and properties in your Solution. Executing SQL Scripts from Data Flows Scripts are executed as Tasks in Data Flow Items hosted in Data Flows. To add a Task for executing a SQL Script to a Data Flow Item, drag and drop the \"Execute SQL Script\" template from the Script Tasks node in the Data Flow Item Templates toolbox. (Available when the Tasks node of the Data Flow Item Explorer has focus.) Next, you need to configure the new task by: Specifying the Script Id: Using the Data Flow Item parameter @[ScriptId]. Specify the argument by using the @Object[<script navn>].Id-directive or hard coding the value. If you want to hard code the Script Id, you can find it by right-clicking the node in the Solution Explorer and select \"Copy Id to Clipboard\". Specifying a language code (optional): It can be hardcoded or provided as an argument. You need to specify a language code if the script is using a directive that requires a language code execution context. Mapping any script parameters: Name : Specifies the name of the parameter used in the script. DataType : Specifies the data type of the parameter. Value : Specifies the argument. The value can be a Data Flow Item parameter of a hardcoded value.

Workbooks are compiled from Solution components and can be designed to support a broad range of business processes and needs. Website / Backend The website is hosted by the IIS web server which serves the user interface and web requests.

There is only one Data Flow Task Manager per install site. Data Flow Task Worker(s) The Data Flow Task Worker is responsible for executing a Data Flow Item. Each Data Flow Item is executed in an isolated process which prevents it from affecting other processes if a fatal error should occur. Since Data Flow Items may take up a lot of system resources when executed, it is recommended (but not required) that Data Flow Task Workers run on different servers than the website to prevent slow response times to the end users. Data Flow Scheduler The Data Flow Scheduler is responsible for running scheduled Data Flows.

This makes it easy to integrate with other tools, such as Excel or a custom Web Service, to export and import data to and from InVision. See how to create a table, configure the table schema in the video section here. Unlike Data Stores, Tables do not have data sources and you cannot apply foreign key constraints to Tables. Time Frame To enable features such as Periodic Input, Rollover, and Transaction Pipeline Processing, you need to set up the Time Frame configuration for a Setting. The Time Frame is the feature that all date-related information for Settings and Data Stores are derived from, which makes it a very important part of most InVision solutions.

You can read the value of a Workbook variable by calling AppVariables.getValue(\"variable name\") or reading the value directly as a property from the AppVariables object : AppVariables.TheVariable. Example Suppose you have assigned a value to the variable Factor in your workbook, you can get the value of Factor in your formula like this: @Amount[] = @TotalForce[] * AppVariables.getValue(\"Factor\"); or @Amount[] = @TotalForce[] * AppVariables.Factor AppVariables.getValue(\"X\") vs AppVariables.X You need use the getValue(‚Ä¶) function rather than accessing the property if your variable name contains white spaces. For example, if your variable is called @Var[My Variable], using AppVariables.@Var[My Variable] will not work because a property name cannot contain whitespace and [] characthers. Instead, you would need to use AppVariables.getValue(\"@Var[My Variable]\"); Executing formulas after an AppVariable has been changed If you modify an AppVariable outside of a Worksheet or Setting, (for example from a Form Element), and that AppVariable is used in a formula, you need to invoke the RecalcAction of the Worksheet of Setting.

You would want to use this option over standard formulas when one or more of the following applies: In order to do the calculations, you need data that is not available in the data set of the spreadsheet, or in the data set of other spreadsheets loaded in the Workbook. You need to do fairly complex calculations with a lot of conditionals (if-else). You need to use math functions or custom logic that is not supported by the standard Eaze library. You want the calculation service to maintain state between executions (the calculation service executes whenever a cell value change). You want one instance of the calculation service pr spreadsheet. Setting up a Calculation Instance Factory To set up a Calculation Instance Factory, click \"Insert Configuration Template\". This will create an Xml configuration like the one below: <ComputeInstanceFactory> <Instance Name=\"my.calculator\" FactoryFunction=\"myLib.createCalculator\"> <FactoryFunctionArguments> <SqlScript Id=\"sql script object id | @Object[sql script name].Id\"/> ... </FactoryFunctionArguments> </Instance> </ComputeInstanceFactory> <Instance Name=\"calculation service instance name\"/> specifies the name of the variable that the calculation service created by the FactoryFunction is assigned to. Use this name to call a function in your calculation service. For example, with <Instance Name=\"my.calculator\"/>, if the created calculation service has a function 'add', you can call the add function from a formula like this: this.my.calculator.add(‚Ä¶) <Instance FactoryFunction=\"factory function name\"/> specifies the name of the function called by InVision to create an instance of the calculation service. The factory function must be available on the (browser) window object, and it must return a new instance of a the calculation service. The factory function can take 0 or many arguments, which can be defined in the FactoryFunctionArguments section. <SqlScript id=\"id|@Object[<name>].Id\"/> specifies a Sql Script in the Solution that returns some data. The Sql Scripts in the FactoryFunctionArguments section is passed as arguments to the FactoryFunction in the order they are defined. At the moment, only SQL Scripts that returns data are supported. You can specify the Id of the SQL Script either using the actual object id, or using the @Object[<name>].Id syntax. What is a Calculation Service A calculation service is simply a JavaScript object that has the necessary business logic to perform some operation on data related to a spreadsheet. What is the Factory Function A factory function is a function that creates an instance of a calculation service and returns it to the spreadsheet calculation engine. Creating a Calculation Service and Factory Function You have two options for creating a calculation service and factory function: Use a JavaScript Solution Object when you need small and / or simple calculation service. Develop, test and build using your preferred toolbox, for example TypeScript, Visual Studio Code, NodeJS, Jasmine, etc and then deploy to the /Scripts/plugins folder so that it's loaded to Workbooks. If you have dependencies on 3rd party libraries, such as requirejs, d3js etc, you need to edit the plugins.json file in the /Scripts/plugins folder and list all files in the order that they should be loaded in the browser. The contents of the file must have the following format: { \"files\" : [\"3rdparty-lib1.js\", \"3rdparty-lib2\", \"mycalc-lib.js\"] } Primary Operators Operator . (x.y) Member access.

    "keywords": "Dropdown Selection Specifies whether the column editor should be a dropdown editor. The configuration for setting up a Dropdown editor column depends on whether the column is a standard column or a linked dimension column. Options Merge with Target Column Items Enable this property in the rare cases when the Worksheet contains values in the column that cannot be found in the data source. Enforce uniqueness Enable this property to prevent the user from selecting the same value from the Dropdown editor for two different rows. Distinct Values Specifies that the Dropdown editor should only contain distinct values from the Dropdown data source. Disable Access Control Only applies to Dropdowns for linked dimension columns. Specifies that any Access Control rules defined for the dimension should be ignored when loading data to the Dropdown editor. Setting up Dropdown for a linked dimension column Note! (Only applies to Worksheets) When setting up Dropdown editing for a linked dimension column, you first need to ensure that the Data Store column that the dimension is bound to in the star schema configuration is added to the Worksheet. Note! If there is no fact data source attached to the Data Store column, you need to ensure that the dimension binding type is set to \"Relationship\". Because the star schema binding configuration specifies the relationship between the dimension column and the Data Store column, the Data Store column added to the Worksheet will get its values updated when the user selects a value from the Dropdown editor containing dimension property values. To enable Dropdown editing of the column, check \"Enable Dropdown Selection\" in the property editor. Setting up Dropdown for a standard column When setting up Dropdown editing of a standard column, you need to specify where the dropdown editor should get its values from, and optionally which other columns in the grid to update based on the selected value. Specify Data Source using @Object directive Allows specifying the Data Source for the dropdown editor using the @Object-directive. We use this property when setting up a Dropdown for resources that should be deployed as part of a template. Using the @Object-directive allows you to specify the Solution object name of the Dropdown data source instead of the materialized table name, which is unique for each object instance. Source Table Specifies the data source for the Dropdown editor. The data source can be a Data Store, Setting, Fact, Dimension or View. Source Value Member Column The column in the data source that should be used as the display member of the dropdown list. Target Column The column in the data set of the grid to have its value updated from Source Column. Secondary Update Using the Secondary Update option, you can set up the Dropdown editor to set the value of a second column in the grid when a value is selected. Source Display Member Column The column in the data source that contains the values to use for updating the second column in the grid. Target Column The second column of the grid to update when a value is selected in the Dropdown editor. Custom Display Column Expression A Sql expression that returns the value to display in the Dropdown column. Note When you apply a Custom Display Column Expression to a Dropdown column editor, you need to use Custom Query and apply the same expression to the corresponding column in the custom query. Example Suppose you have a Worksheet with a linked dimension column and want to enable Dropdown editing of the column, but you want to display a computed value in the dropdown editor. The column name is ‚Äòaccount167AccountID_Name‚Äô. 1) In the Dropdown editor configuration, specify the following expression SUBSTRING(@Context.ObjectAlias.AccountID_Name,0,2) AS account167AccountID_Name 2) From the Query tab in the Worksheet designer, enable \"Use custom query to load data\" and edit, Sync with Designer to get the standard query expression and edit the column expression for the joined dimension column. SELECT store.PBRowIdentity, ISNULL(store.IsLocked,0) AS IsLocked, SUBSTRING(T0.[AccountID_Name],0,2) AS [account167AccountID_Name] ,store.[AccountID] AS [AccountID] FROM [Store_Hypotesia_05182015125711] store INNER JOIN [dbo].[DimLink_AccountWOarPFrSvNwgMF9XY3OC_account167] T0 ON store.[AccountID] = T0.[AccountID] COLLATE DATABASE_DEFAULT Filter A Sql expression used in a WHERE clause to filter the values of the Dropdown editor. Example SUBSTRING(@Context.ObjectAlias.AccountID_Name,0,2) = '12' You can use custom parameters as part of the filter expression, which enables the dropdown list to contain only a subset of the default items. To use this option, you need to use the SetParamValue(‚Ä¶) and ReloadDropDownItems(‚Ä¶) directives in the LoadData action of the Workbook component. Example This example shows how to use a custom parameter to filter the available items in the dropdown editor. To pass a value to the @ItemID parameter, you must use the SetParamValue(‚Ä¶) and the @ReloadDropDownItems(‚Ä¶) instructions in the LoadData action of the Workbook component. The LoadData action instruction list must contain the following: SetParamValue(\"@ItemID\",@Var[ItemID]); ReloadDropDownItems(); The filter expression: @Context.ObjectAlias.ItemID = @ItemID Order By A SQL expression used for ordering the values of the Dropdown editor. Example LEFT(@Context.ObjectAlias.AccountID_Name,2) See Also Dropdown - Form Elements Dropdown - Control Videos Dropdown Selection Dropdown"

    "keywords": "What is Ranked Input Ranked Input enables providing input relative to different levels of dimensions. When data is saved, the Setting is \"compiled\" by unwrapping the data at the lowest level of the dimension based on the Ranked Input data. If there is more than one column set up as a Ranked Input column, the result of the compilation will be the Cartesian product of the values at the lowest level of the dimensions. Compile on Save Enable this option to automatically compile the setting table when data is saved. Note that the compilation process can take some time, so if you do not need the compilation to run immediately, you can compile the setting at some later point using a Data Flow. Automatically recompile when Ranked Input Column Source is updated Enabled by default. Requires that the solution model is compiled. The contents generated when a Ranked Input Setting table is compiled is tied directly to the data and structure of the Ranked Input source dimension (hierarchy + levels). That's why the Setting table needs to be recompiled whenever a Ranked Input source dimension is updated. When this feature is enabled, InVision will automatically recompile the table when the Ranked Input source dimension is reloaded or updated. This feature is enabled by default. Consider turning it off for setting tables where you have multiple Ranked Input Columns and it takes a long time to compile the output. The auto compilation will occur when a source dimension is updated, so a setting table with two Ranked Input Columns will be compiled two times. If you are updating both dimensions, it is faster to disable this feature and compile the setting using in a custom Data Flow instead. This way, the compilation will only happen once, regardless of how many Ranked Input Columns there are. Specificity The Ranked Input data set is compiled based on specificity, where the order of the rows determines the specificity from lower to higher (think of it as a reversed rank). When compiled, the result of the first (topmost) row is resolved first since it has the lowest specificity. Next, the result of each consecutive row is merged into the data set. When the compilation of consecutive rows produces data matching rows already present in the data set, the existing rows are overwritten by the new ones. For example, suppose you want to enter values relative to a Department dimension, you would put the Enterprise level setting as row 1, then any Region level setting(s) for overriding the Enterprise setting, and finally Department level settings as the final override. To enable the user to order the rows in the desired order from lowest to highest specificity, you need to add a column to the Setting that the system can use for sorting the rows. The data type of the column must be Integer, but you are free to choose the name and index of the column. Next, you need to specify that the column should be used for determining the specificity by going to the Features -> Ranked Input screen and choosing the column from the specificity Dropdown list. When the specificity column has been set up, the user can move rows up and down using the context menu of the grid."

    "keywords": "Table View Table View is used for displaying data in a read-only data grid. Compared to spreadsheet tables (Worksheet, Table, and SQL Report) which is used for editing data, Table View is used for displaying data in a user-friendly and nicely formatted way. The component has built-in features for selection, sorting, filtering, formatting, and custom renderers. Data Use a SQL query to define the data set that is displayed in a Table View. You can load data from any database table or view it in the Solution database. To enable access control, use filters that reference dimensions using the same syntax that you are using to create SQL Reports. You can also use macros to create highly dynamic queries using C#. Data Grid layout and behavior The Data Grid tab in the Table View designer is where you create the layout and behavior by adding columns from the data set and setting properties for selection, paging, and filtering. Before you can create the layout, run the (Data Source) SQL query so that you can easily add columns to the data grid from the data set. Columns To configure a column, select it from the Columns list and edit its properties in the Properties window. How to create dynamic and localized column captions If you need a dynamic column caption, or you need to support localization, use the Caption Expression to create a C# expression that returns a string. Example This caption expression translates the text associated with the \"AccountID\" text code to the language of the currently logged-in user: Localize(\"AccountID\") How to render the custom cell content Use the Renderer column property to define a JavaScript function that returns the HTML element to render in the cell. Example This example shows how to use a custom renderer to render a SVG into a cell: function(eventArgs, services){ const importancePct = (eventArgs.value / 10) * 100; const svg = document.createElementNS(\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\", \"svg\"); svg.setAttribute(\"width\", \"100%\"); svg.setAttribute(\"height\", \"30px\"); const newRect = document.createElementNS(\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\", \"rect\"); newRect.setAttribute(\"width\", importancePct + '%'); newRect.setAttribute(\"height\", \"100%\"); newRect.setAttribute(\"fill\", importancePct > 50 ? 'green' : 'yellow'); svg.appendChild(newRect); return svg; } How to format cells You can format numeric and date/datetime cells using the Format String or Formatter property. How to define context menu actions You can define custom actions pr column that the user can execute. Custom actions are defined with the Context Menu Actions property. When a user executes an action, the action can be acted upon in the Workbook by handling the \"Custom Context Menu Action executed\" event of the Table View component. In the event handler, you can access the following properties of the **@Event** object. { Data: {}, // the row object of the cell that was clicked Selection:{ Rows: [{ Columns: [], // array of column names of the row (keys) RowData: {ColumnName: cellValue, ...} // each key and value of the row }], // All the selected rows Cells: [{ RowData: \"cell value\", Column: \"name of the column\"}, ... ] // All the selected cells }, Sender:{ ActionName: \"the name of the context menu action that was executed\", ColumnName: \"the name of the column\" } } How to filter on one or more columns To enable filtering on one or more columns, set the Enable filter property to the true for each column that you want to filter on. This will add a filtering option for the column to the filter bar at the top of the Table View component in the Workbook. The filter options for a column are based on its data type. For example, a numeric column can be filtered using numeric operators such as less than or greater than, while a text column can be filtered by equals, contains, starts with, and so on. If you want to instead enable the user to pick from a list of values in the column, use the Filter Type property and switch from Default to Select. How to use row selectability Developers can write JavaScript that evaluates whether or not specific rows are selectable by the user in TableView components. That provides developers fine-grained control over whether or not a row can be selected by a user based on business logic and application state. Example This function will return true if the value of args.row.Ratings is greater than or equal to 8, which means that the row will be selectable if the ratings are equal to or higher than 8.: function (args: {rows: any[], row: any, variables: {[index: string]: any}}): boolean { return (args.row.Ratings >= 8); } Rerender The Table View can be re-rendered manually at any time. A typical use case for when you want to trigger a re-render is when some application state outside the TableView has changed, and you want this state to be reflected in the TableView. This functionality is intended for controls that do not automatically refresh the TableView. Note This re-rendering process does not involve reloading data from the backend, but rather only involves the TableView re-rendering itself on the client-side. This action can be called in the interaction window of the control. How to pin columns to left or right You can pin columns to left or right using the Fixed State property. How to declare filter You can filter table view using hierarchical filter, to do that you need to declare that filter in the load query. You will find more here in Data Queries subject, and in this example. How to enable excel export You can enable excel export, to do that you need to check \"enable excel export\" box and insert code template in the EXCEL EXPORT tab. When you click the \"C# Insert Code Template\", it will be inserted. //This method is call for every header cell public override ExcelExportHeaderCellOutput RenderHeaderCell(ExcelExportRenderHeaderCellInput input) { //input.RowIndex (int) //input.ColumnIndex (int) //input.Caption (string) var output = CreateExcelExportHeaderCellOutput(input); //output.Caption (string) //output.ColumnSpan (string) //output.Font.Bold (bool) //output.Font.Italic (bool) //output.Font.Size (bool) //output.HorizontalAlignment (string - 'left' | 'right' | 'center') output.Font.Bold = true; return output; } //This method is called for every data cell public override ExcelExportDataCellOutput RenderDataCell(ExcelExportRenderDataCellInput input) { //input.RowIndex (int) //input.ColumnIndex (int) //input.Value (string) //input.Row (DataRow) //input.Column (DataColumn) var output = CreateExcelExportDataCellOutput(input); //output.RowIndex = input.RowIndex; //output.ColumnIndex = input.ColumnIndex; //output.Value = input.Value; //output.FormatString (string) //output.Font.Bold (bool) //output.Font.Italic (bool) //output.Font.Size (bool) //output.HorizontalAlignment (string - 'Left' | 'Right' | 'Center') output.HorizontalAlignment = \"Right\"; return output; } Videos Table View Table View - Basics Table View - Macro Expansion Table View -Custom Cell Renderer Table View - Declaring Filter Table View - Enable Excel Export Table View - Row Selectability Condition Table View - Rerender"

    "title": "Time Frame | Profitbase Docs",
    "keywords": "Time Frames specifies the core configuration used for supporting time relative features, such as Periodic Input, Rollover, and Transaction Pipeline Distribution. Time Frames are defined by a Time Dimension, a Reference Date, Calendar Type, and the Resolution. In addition, you can specify a Source Reference Date which can be used by the Pivot Transform when importing data to a Data Store. Time Frames can be configured for Data Stores, Settings, or Data Store Groups. If you configure a Time Frame for a Data Store Group, descendants of the group can inherit the Time Frame. For a Time Frame to have any effect, you need to add Time Frame Measure Columns to the Data Stores and Settings. Time Frame Measure Columns are special numeric columns that denote which periods in time the values of the columns apply to. You can view the Time Frame/Time Frame Measure Column concepts as a \"coordinate\" system having only an x-axis in which time flows along. The Reference Date would be the origin and the Resolution would represent the distance between each point along the axis. The location (starting date) and extent (ending date) of a Time Frame Measure Column along the axis would be determined by its Offset and Length properties. Configuring Time Frame for Data Store Group Configuring a Time Frame for a Data Store Group enables descendant Data Stores and Settings to inherit the configuration so that all members of the group can share the same Time. To set up the Time Frame for a Data Store Group, go to the Time Frame tab in the Data Store Group editor. Refer to the following topic for setting up the Time Frame configuration. Configuring Time Frame for Data Store or Setting To configure the Time Frame for a Data Store or Setting, go to the Time Frame tab in the Data Store or Setting editor. If the Data Store or Setting is a descendant of a Data Store Group having a Time Frame configured, the Data Store or Setting can inherit the Time Frame configuration from the Data Store Group by selecting \"Inherit from Ancestor\". When Time Frame inheritance is enabled, the Data Store or Setting inherits the Time Frame configuration from the closes Data Store Group having a valid Time Frame configuration. If the Data Store or Setting is not a descendant of a Data Store Group, or you want to use a Time Frame configuration local to the entity, you need to specify the Time Frame configuration explicitly. Time Frame Configuration Inherit from Ancestor Specifies that the entity will inherit the Time Frame configuration from an entity higher in the Solution Structure. For Data Stores and Settings that are members of the same group, you would normally use inheritance to ensure they use the same Time Frame. Time Dimension Specifies the Time Dimension used by the Time Frame. When configuring the Time Frame for a Data Store, the Time Dimension must be added to the Data Store Layout, but it does not have to be connected to the Data Store Schema. Resolution Specifies the resolution for the Time Frame. Possible values are Year, Quarter, Month, Week, and Day. The resolution is the base measure for calculating the date range of a Time Frame Column based on the Length and Offset property. Reference Date The Reference Data specifies the origin used for calculating dates from a Time Frame. Its main function is to enable support for setting up Data Stores and Settings used for periodic input and provide the control mechanism for doing rollovers using Time Frame Columns. Imagine time flows along the x-axis, the Time Frame Columns are the points along the axis, and the Reference Date is the origin. The Reference Date is used for calculating the date range for Time Frame Columns, how data is shifted during rollovers, importing data to Data Stores using pivoting, and exporting data from Data Stores using unpivot. The Reference Date can also be referred to in scripts and data flows using one or more of the Timeframe @Object[‚Ä¶] ‚Äì directives. Source Reference Date The Source Reference Date can be used for filtering data when importing or exporting data to Data Stores using the pivot or unpivot transforms. Using the Source Reference Date rather than hardcoded date filters should be used when the Data Store is enabled for rollover since the Source Reference Date can be updated according to the rollover delta. Calendar Type Specifies whether the Time Frame should use a natural or alternative (fiscal) calendar. To use an Alternative Calendar, you need to specify a Time Dimension and the columns in the Time Dimension representing the date parts (year, quarter, month, week, and day).

Updating / Resetting cache For performance reasons, the contents of pbSimLangText is cached after the first request.

Typical use cases for Web Functions are: You need to call external Web Services, such as Azure Functions, Microsoft Cognitive Services, or any other 3rd party (web) APIs, and return the result to the InVision backend or a Workbook. You need to call external web services that require authentication. You create microservices to handle custom business logic in customer projects, and you want to call these services from Workbooks. You need to combine the execution of external web services and internal resources, such as SQL scripts. Web Functions are written in C#. Creating Web Functions When you create a new Web Function, the default template will look like this: namespace Custom.WebFunctions { using System; using System.Net; using System.Text; using System.Data; using System.Linq; using System.Dynamic; using System.Net.Http; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Newtonsoft.Json; using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq; using Profitbase.Invision.WebFunctions; public sealed class MyWebFunction : WebFunction { public async Task<IActionResult> Run(HttpRequest request) { return await Task.FromResult(Ok()); } } } As you can see, this is just a normal C# class with a single method **Run**, that accepts a single argument and returns a HTTP response. A Web Function must follow 3 simple rules, but besides that, you can do whatever you want: A Web Function must always implement a public Run method, The Run method must accept a single argument, the HttpRequest, The Run method must return a IActionResult. A Web Function can inherit from the WebFunction base class. This gives you access to built-in APIs from InVision.

    "keywords": "Run Web Functions from a Workbook There are two ways you can run Web Functions from a Workbook. Use the Execute Web Function action. Recommended for most purposes. Use the generic Web Api action if you need to run a Web Function that is a different Solution than the Workbook. Use the Execute Web Function action The recommended way to run a Web Function is to use the Execute Web Function action from the Workbook Actions list as shown in the image below. You need to do the following: Drag and drop the action from the toolbox into the Actions list Specify the name of the Web Function to run. In addition, you can also specify query parameters and a payload. Use Execute(...) to specify the name of the Web Function to run. Execute(...) returns a response handle that you can use to get the value returned from the Web Function (see example below). [Optional] Use SetData(...) to specify a payload. Then, in the Web Function implementation, use the GetRequestBodyAsync method to get the object. [Optional] Use SetQueryString(..) to specify a query string. Then, in the Web Function implementation, use the GetRequestQueryString method to get the value. ** Example** SetData({ CustomerId: \"1234\", Name: \"Hypotesia\" }); SetQueryString(\"api_key=secret\"); _response = Execute(\"UpdateCustomer\"); // Use _response.Data to access the value returned from the Web Function in subsequent Workbook component actions. Web Function implementation The sample implementation below shows how to use the GetRequestBodyAsync and GetRequestQueryString methods to read the data and query string sent from the Workbook. namespace Custom.WebFunctions { public record RequestMessage(string CustomerId, string Name); public sealed class MyWebFunction : WebFunction { public async Task<IActionResult> Run(HttpRequest request) { var apiKey = GetRequestQueryString(request, \"api_key\"); // TODO: Use the api key to do authorization var requestMessage = await GetRequestBodyAsync<RequestMessage>(request); await this.SqlCommandService.ExecuteNonQueryAsync(\"UPDATE Customers SET Name = @name WHERE CustomerID = @customerId\", new SqlParameter(\"@name\", requestMessage.Name), new SqlParameter(\"@customerId\", requestMessage.CustomerId)); return await Task.FromResult(Ok(\"ello\")); } } } Use the generic Web Api action If you need to run Web Functions that are in different Solutions than the Workbook, use the generic WebApi Action, paired with HttpGet(‚Ä¶), HttpPost(‚Ä¶), HttpPut(‚Ä¶), HttpPatch(‚Ä¶) or HttpDelete(‚Ä¶) methods to configure the request. All the Http methods returns a response handle that you can use to obtain any data returned from a Web Function once the WebApi action has completed. The response handle has a Data property that contains the actual data returned from the Web Function, for example a string, a business object, an array of objects and so on. Endpoints api/solutions/{solutionId}/webfunctions/{web function name} Use this endpoint if you need to run a Web Function that is in a different Solution than the Workbook. Example HttpPut(\"api/solutions/\" + SYS.SolutionId + \"/webfunctions/My_Web_Function1\", { CustomerID: _selectedCustomer.ID, Name: Input_CustomerName.Value, }); api/webfunctions/{web function name} You can use this endpoint if you have only one solution, or you know that no other web functions with the same name exists. Example _responseHandle = HttpGet( \"api/webfunctions/My_Web_Function2?customerId=\" + _selectedCustomer.ID ); Example This example shows how to call a Web Function from a Workbook by issuing a HTTP Put request. First, you need to invoke a WebApi Action. The WebApi Action is an action available on the Workbook Object itself. In the WebApi Action instructions list, call the HttpPut method to configure the request with the url and payload. In the WebApi Action instructions list: HttpPut(\"api/webfunctions/My_Web_Function1\", { CustomerID: _selectedCustomer.ID, Name: Input_CustomerName.Value, }); Example This example shows how to call a Web Function from a Workbook and read the data returned from the request. Calling HttpGet(‚Ä¶) returns a handle that you can use obtain the data returned from the Web Function once the WebApi action completes. The response handle has a Data property that contains the data returned by the Web Function. In the WebApi Action instructions list: _responseHandle = HttpGet( \"api/webfunctions/My_Web_Function2?customerId=\" + _selectedCustomer.ID ); Once the WebApi action completes, the data returned by the Web Function is available from the Data property of the response handle. So if the Web Function returns a customer object with a CustomerName property, you can get the customer name by simply accessing that property. ShowToastNotification(\"Customer Name\", _responseHandle.Data.CustomerName);"

The main advantage of using the Data API instead of the OData API is better performance for large data sets and that you can use API Key authentication which may be easier for some clients. Note There is no row-level access control associated with an API Key, meaning once you have an API Key, you have read access to all the data in the database. Getting an API Key To use the Data API, you need to use API Key authentication. The API Key is sent as part of the request, so you should make sure that you are always using an https connection. To get an API Key to use with the Data API, go to: Application Menu -> API Management -> Manage API Keys. In the Data tab, find an existing key or create a new.

Workbooks belonging to Work Processes are automatically grouped by the Work Process and version they belong to. The system comes with a default menu, but you can create additional menus if you want to separate different work processes or business solutions. For example, if you are a manager of a production facility, you will have both operational and administrative responsibilities. If you have a large custom solution for production management, you might or might not want all the Workbooks from your production management app in the same menu as your financial planning app. With the option to create multiple Workbook menus, customers get the option to decide how they want their identities to be able to navigate between all the Workbooks they have access to. Some would like to have everything available on the same menu, while others like to keep things focused. Structuring A menu can be structured with folders, Workbooks, and Work Processes using the InVision Designer. Folders are typically used for grouping Workbooks that logically belong together. Folders can have any type of children, so you can use folders to create menu hierarchies as deep as you want (although we don't recommend creating it more than a few levels deep). Workbooks can be placed at the root level of a menu, or as children of a folder. Workbooks cannot have children of their own. Note Workbook can only belong to a single menu. Work Processes can be placed in a menu using either the InVision Designer or the Work Process configuration screen in a Workbook. Work Processes can be placed at the root level or in folders. Versions and Workbooks that belong to a Work Process is automatically displayed in the menu. Work Processes should always be added to the default system menu. When using the InVision Designer you can place Work Processes in custom menus, but when using the web interface, all Work Processes will automatically be placed in the system menu. A Workbook will appear in a menu if the following holds true: The current user has been granted access to the Workbook The Workbook has been explicitly added to a menu, or the Workbook belongs to a Work Process with a Version that is either in the Deployed, Open or Closed state While a Work Process version is in the Deployed state, only Work Process administrators will have access to the Workbook Example Placing a Workbook in a menu using the InVision Designer: In the InVision Designer, from the application menu, choose Workbook Menu -> Workbook Menu Designer, Choose the System Menu (or create a custom menu), Click Add Workbook or right click a folder to add a Workbook, If you want to reposition the Workbook, drag and drop it to the new location.

    "keywords": "In order to execute Data Flows from a Workbook, you need to add them to a page. If you do not want to show the execution log of a Data Flow to the user, you can add it to a hidden page. You can still indicate that some process is running by adding spinners and starting and stopping them when the Data Flow starts and stops. Actions Start It starts an asynchronous execution of the Data Flow. This action does not wait for the Data Flow to complete its execution, it returns immediately once the execution has started. Stop Sends a request to the server asking to stop the current execution of the Data Flow. The execution is not guaranteed to stop immediately, instead it will stop at the first available opportunity. Events Completed The Completed event is raised when the Data Flow completes execution. The event is raised when the Data Flow completes normally, and after an abort request has been sent by the Stop action. Executing Data Flows To start executing a Data Flow from a Workbook, you need to call the Start Action of the Data Flow. Calling the Start action will start a new instance of the Data Flow. When the Start action returns, it means that the execution has started, not that the Data Flow has run to completion. When the Data Flow has run to completion, the Data Flow raises the Completed event. Parameterized execution To pass arguments to a Data Flow being executed from a Workbook, you need to edit the Arguments property of the Data Flow part from the Workbook designer. The editor shows a list of all activities and their respective parameters hosted by the Data Flow. When selecting the activity, you get a list of the parameters and any default arguments. To override the default values, you can use variables, the Filter(‚Ä¶) function, or hard coded values. InVision resolves the arguments by evaluating all values as Eaze expressions. Example This example shows how to specify the arguments passed to a Data Flow Activity. The values listed in the Default Value column is used unless a value is provided in the Override Value column. The values in the Override Value column must be valid Eaze expressions, meaning they can contain references to variables. In this example, a variable x = \"FOO\" exists. (We‚Äôre referencing it in the myAbbrev argument expression, by only getting the first 2 letters). Argument name Default Value Override Value myInt 1 1 myString Hello \"Hello\" myDate 1900.01.01 DATE(1900,1,1) myDec 22.4 11.6 myDepartment Filter(\"Filters\", \"Department\").SelectedValue.Id myAbbrev SUBSTRING(x, 0, 2) Data Context Scope To apply a Data Context for transactions, being processed based on states (selected filter values and variables) in the Workbook, you need to specify the Data Context Scope for the Data Flow. Setting up a Data Context Scope for the execution will enable the Data Flow to only process the transaction subset resolved from the selected filter values and variables in the Workbook. Read more about the Data Context and Data Context Scope here. What is the difference between parameterized execution for filtering data to process and using Data Context Scope? The Data Context Scope enables the system to resolve the transaction subset for processing while using parameterized execution leaves it up to the consultant to set up the filtering logic. Some business modules, for example, the Finance module, uses the reserved system column SYS_DataSetID to specify which data set in various tables belongs to which business process (for example, Budget or Forecast). To process the correct data set when running a Data Flow from a Workbook, you need to configure the Data Context (of the Data Flow) and provide the id of the data set to process. You do this by selecting the appropriate Data Flow Component in the Workbook Designer and then edit its Data Context property. Next, you need to assign a value to the Data Context variable(s). Business modules developed by Profitbase usually defines a single Data Context variable named **@SYS_DataSetID**, but there may be more than one. The Data Context variables and their mappings are defined in the Global Data Context. To assign a value to a Data Context Variable, for example, @SYS_DataSetID, add a row to the Data Context Variables Assignment list in the Data Context property editor and select the @SYS_DataSetID entry from the dropdown. In the Workbook Variable field, type the name of the variable that contains the id of the data set that identifies the business process (for example, Budget or Forecast) that you want to target. If the Workbook is associated with a Workflow, the SYS.SYS_DataSetID variable contains the id of the data set. A Workflow represents a business process and has the Data Set configuration where the id of the business process is specified. So, in short, to use SYS_DataSetID to target a specific data set when processing data, you need to do the following: Select the Data Flow Component in a Workbook and edit its Data Context property; Add a row to the Data Context Variables Assignment list; Choose the **@SYS_DataSetID** item from the dropdown list; If the Workbook is associated with a Workflow, type SYS.SYS_DataSetID in the Workbook Variable field If the Workbook is not associated with a Workflow, type the name of some other variable (your custom) that contains the id of the data set you want to target If you didn't get the expected result after setting up the Data Context, probably: The Global Data Context does not contain mappings between Data Context variable(s) and table columns, for example the @SYS_DataSetID variable is not mapped to the SYS_DataSetID column of a table participating in the execution of the Data Flow. Resources (Data Views) in Data Flow Items are not configured to filter based on the Data Context. Tabular resources (tables, views) referenced in Data Flow Items as Resource references must contain a special WHERE clause to apply filtering based on the Data Context. If this WHERe clause is not present, no filtering is applied. Runtime information When a Data Flow is started, InVision creates a variable with the name of the Data Flow part and assigns an info object to the variable containing a TaskId and DataFlowId property. DataFlowId is the (metadata) id of the Data Flow. TaskId is the Id of the execution instance. Every time a Data Flow is started, it gets a unique execution id, but the DataFlowId stays the same. If you are creating custom Data Flow Items, the TaskId and DataFlowId can be read from the Infinity runtime and used for tagging output relative to the execution instance. This makes it possible to load resources generated by a Data Flow, for example a PDF or some other content, once the Data Flow has completed. Example This example shows how to access the DataFlowId or TaskId properties of a Data Flow, ¬´DataFlow1\", after it has been started by addressing the variable created when the Data Flow has been started. @Var[DataFlow1].DataFlowId // returns the metadata if of the executing data flow @Var[DataFlow1].TaskId // returns the execution instance id Logging To display the Data Flow while it‚Äôs running, you need to set the Show Execution Log property to True in the properties editor. Also, the Data Flow cannot be hosted on a hidden page. Note If the Show Execution Log property is set to true, the Popup Execution Errors property is ignored. Error notifications To enable error notifications, you need to set the Popup Execution Errors property to True in the Properties editor. Note If the Show Execution Log property is set to true, the Popup Execution Errors property is ignored.

Once a Filter is defined, it can be used by all data context-aware components in a Solution by binding the Filter to a property of the component. A Filter is defined as a reference to table resource (Dimension, Fact, Setting, Data Store, or a View) and by a configuration describing how to read data from the table resource. Place the chosen filter in your solution by dragging and dropping it from the Toolbox in Workbook designer. Set the properties of the filter. Make sure that your filter will load when you open your Solution. Open Workbook Events and drag and drop an Action from the Available Actions list. Than set the Events, Actions and Instructions of the Filter. Show and Hide Filters You can toggle the visibility of a filter in a Workbook on and off. Option 1: Specify the Is Hidden or Is Hidden Expression property in the Filter property pane. The Is Hidden Expression is a C# expression that must return true or false. If you specify an Is Hidden Expression, it will override the Is Hidden property. Both of these properties are evaluated only once and sets the initial visibility of the filter. Option 2: Use the Execute Expression action of a filter to toggle its visibility on and off by using one of the following functions: Hide(); HideIf(boolean expression); Show(); ShowIf(boolean expression); Filter headings Option 1: Use the Header or the Header Expression property in the Filter property pane. The Header property specifies the default heading of the filter. The Header Expression property is a C# expression that must return a string. If you specify a Header Expression, it will override the Header property. Both of these properties are evaluated on the server when the Workbook is loaded. This means that you cannot use any Workbook parameters in the Header Expression, and the Header Expression is evaluated only once. The most common use case for using the Header Expression is localization. If you want to heading of the filter to display in the language of the user, you must use the Localize(...) function in the Header Expression. Example: Assuming that the text code \"TXT_Currency\" is a registered text code in the Localization system, the following expression will display the heading to the user in their language. Localize(\"TXT_Currency\"); Option 2: Use the Execute Expression action of a filter to dynamically change the heading by using one of the following instructions: SetHeader(text: string); // Changes the header SetHeaderSuffix(suffix: string); // Appends a suffix to the default header ResetHeader(); // Resets the header back to the default value See Also More about Filters Filtering Tables Filtering Worksheets Videos Filters"

They want the Product filter to contain only the product hierarchies for the products in the spreadsheet, not all products in the Product dimension. To achieve this, you need to call the SetLeafLevelConstraints(‚Ä¶) and specify a list of product ids in the Load Data action of the filter. Example Create a Workbook variable to store the product ids: Create a JavaScript which returns a list of product ids: In the spreadsheet calculations, call the JavaScript and assign the result to the Workbook variable: In the Load Data action of the (Product) filter, call SetLeafLevelConstraint(‚Ä¶) and pass in the variable. Note You need to call Load Data on the filter AFTER the spreadsheet has been loaded, or else the list of product ids has not been created. Videos Workbooks"

    "keywords": "Form Elements defined in the Solution can be added to the Workbook by dragging and dropping them to the desired location. To load and save data, you need to call the LoadData or SaveData actions in response to raised events. The current value of a Form Element instance will always be stored in a variable whose name equals the Form Element instance name (Part Name). For example, the current value of a Form Element part having the name \"MyFormElement\" can be read using the @Var[MyFormElement] statement. Note That Dropdown Form Elements usually contains a list of objects with a display and value member (as specified in the select query), so you would need dot into the object to get either the display or value member. Actions LoadData Loads the value for the Form Element from the database. SaveData Saves the current value of the Form Element to the database. ExecuteExpression Use this action to dynamically style the Form Element by calling the AddCssClass(‚Ä¶), RemoveCssClass(‚Ä¶) and ToggleCssClass(‚Ä¶) functions. Events SelectionChangedEvent This event is raised when the user changes the value of the form element. For text input elements, this event is raised for every character change, and for selection elements the event is raised when a value has been selected. Event Arguments @Event.Data ‚Äì The current value of the form element is passed as the event argument of the SelectionChangedEvent. @Event.Data can be accessed in Actions handling the event. Note! If Form Element is a selection type element (for example a Dropdown) which contains composite items (objects with display and value members as defined by the select query), the selected object will be passed as the event argument, not just the selected value. To read the value of a property of the selected object, access it using the dot-syntax. (See example 2 below). Example When the user types a new value into a Text Input form element, we want to store the value in a variable, MyVar. This is done by setting up an ExecuteExpression action with the following instruction when the SelectionChangedEvent is raised: MyVar = @Event.Data; Example Using a Dropdown Form Element, having a Value and Display Member of \"ProductID\" and \"ProductName\", we want to store the name of the product in a variable, SelectedProductName. This is done by setting up an ExecuteExpression action with the following instruction when the SelectionChanged event is raised: SelectedProductName = @Event.Data.ProductName; HasUnsavedDataEvent This event is raised the first time the user changes the value of the form element. Dynamic styling A Form Element can be dynamically styled by calling the AddCssClass(‚Ä¶), RemoveCssClass(‚Ä¶) and ToggleCssClass(‚Ä¶) functions in the ExecuteExpression action. Example This example shows 3 different ways to add, remove, or toggle the styling of a Form Element by calling AddCssClass, RemoveCssClass, or ToggleCssClass. AddCssClass(\"highlight\"); RemoveCssClass(\"highlight underline\"); ToggleCssClass(\"highlight\", x == 250); Form Element Validation You can apply validation rules to form elements. Validation rules are expressed as Eaze expressions and must return a Boolean value. The expression must evaluate to true in order for the validation to succeed. The validation is executed when the form element changes value, for example when the user selects a value in a Dropdown or when the user has entered some text in a Text Input. When writing validation expressions, you need to use the **@Data** contextual variable to access the current value of the form element. For Form elements such as Dropdown and Date Picker, @Data contains a complex object reflecting the underlying data type such as the Dropdown Value and DisplayMember or the Date Pickers Date object. Keep in mind that the value entered into a Text Input form element is always of data type string, even though you enter a \"number\" like 1000, so if you want to validate the entered value as a numeric type, you need to convert it to a number using the TONUMBER function. Example Suppose we have a Dropdown form element having a Value Member called Pressure, and we would like to validate if the selected item has a Pressure value of at least 1000 (Pa), use the following expression: @Data.Pressure >= 1000; Example Suppose we have a Text Input form element, and we would like to verify that the user has entered a value, you can use the following expression: L > EN(@Data) > 0; Example Suppose we have a Text Input form element, and we would like to verify that the user has entered a numeric value less than 100, you can use the following expression: TONUMBER(@Data) < 100; More about Form Elements Form Elements See Also Label Textbox Dropdown Date Picker"

SelectedCell Properties: RowData : object The data object of the selected cell. Column : string[] The column name of the selected cell. ChartInteractionEvent This event can be raised from a Highchart event handler, for example the click event of a point. To raise this event, you need to add an event handler to the chart component that you want to raise that event from, and then raise the ChartInteraction event. Example To raise the ChartInteraction event when a point is clicked, add a JavaScript library to your solution and generate a default script. This will create a myUtil function object. Add the following function to the myUtil function object: myUtil.onPointClick = function(){ this.series.chart.componentContext.eventDispatcher.raiseEvent ('ChartInteraction', {x : this.x, y : this.y}, this.series.chart.componentContext.componentId); }; The second argument is the payload you want to pass along as the event argument. Then, find the clicked event of the point of the series, and add a pointer to the function with the func:: prefix. If your solution is called Hypotesia, and the JavaScript Solution object is called Chart Events, the correct pointer name is func::hypotesia.chartevents.myUtil.onPointClick To display the x-value of the clicked series in a toast notification, add an ExecuteExpression action to the Workbook with the following expression: ShowToastNotification(\"Point clicked\", \"X value point is \" + @Event.Data.x); Handling the ChartInteractionEvent from built-in event publishers At the moment, InVision has a built-in function (pb.chart.series.point.events.onClick) that can be set to raise the ChartInteractionEvent when a series point is clicked. The function raises the ChartInteractionEvent with a payload object containing the following properties: X The x-value of the clicked point Y The y value of the clicked point low The low value of the clicked point (for range series). high The high value of the clicked point (for range series). seriesName The name of the series that the point belongs to. data The data object of the clicked point. The data object is the entire data row that the point is rendered from. When handing the ChartInteractionEvent in a Workbook, the payload object is exposed through the **@Event.Data** property, so to get the y value of the clicked point in a Workbook event handler, you would write **@Event.Data.y.** See Also SQL Reports Videos SQL Reports ChartInteractionEvent"

Actions Execute Executes the script. Any arguments are passed by calling SetParamValue(‚Ä¶) one or many times (one for each argument to pass) Executing scripts To execute a Script, you need to call the Execute Action of the Script when an event is raised, for example from a button or context menu. When calling the Execute Action, it will wait until the script has finished executing. Parameterized execution Arguments are passed to a Script using the SetParamValue instruction in the Execute Action handler. Example This example shows a Script with a @ProductID parameter. To execute the Script from a Workbook, you need to pass a product id as an argument, or else the execution of the Script will fail. UPDATE @Object[Sales].DbObjectName SET Amount = 0 WHERE ProductID = @ProductID To pass a product id as an argument, you need to call the SetParamValue function in the Execute Action of the Script. The following expression will pass the value of the ProductID variable to the @ProductID parameter. SetParamValue(¬´@ProductID¬ª,ProductID); Script return values If you have enabled the Script to return data, the first row of the result set returned by the query is serialized an object and assigned to a variable with the same as the Script Workbook part.

The IsFilterSet(‚Ä¶) function checks whether a values has been selected. If it has, the label text is set to the value returned by the Filter(\"Filters\", \"Department\").SelectedValue.Description statement. If not, the label text is set to \"All Departments\". SetTextIf(IsFilterSet(\"Filters\", \"Department\"), Filter(\"Filters\", \"Department\").SelectedValue.Description, \"All Departments\"); Note You have to execute the UpdateText Action of the Label for the text to change. Example 2 The following example shows how the text can be combined using the Eaze CONCAT function. SetTextIf(IsFilterSet(\"Filters\", \"Department\"), CONCAT(\"Selected Department is \", Filter(\"Filters\", \"Department\").SelectedValue.Description), \"No Department is selected\"); Example 3 The following example shows how to use the null coalescing operator (??) to conditionally set the text of a Label to either the Description-value of selected filter item, or \"All\". SetText(Filter(\"Filters\", \"Department\").SelectedValue?.Description ?? \"All\") Example 4 This example shows how to set the value of a Label by directly assigning to the Text property of the Label. This statement must be executed in the UpdateText action of the Label. Assuming the name of the Label is LBL_MyLabel, the expression will be: LBL_MyLabel.Text = \"Hello\"; Dynamic styling A Label can be dynamically styled by calling the AddCssClass(‚Ä¶), RemoveCssClass(‚Ä¶) and ToggleCssClass(‚Ä¶) functions in an ExecuteExpression action. Example This example shows 3 different ways to add, remove or toggle the styling of a label by calling AddCssClass, RemoveCssClass or ToggleCssClass. AddCssClass(\"hightlight\"); RemoveCssClass(\"hightlight underline\"); ToggleCssClass(\"highlight\", x == 250); Translation Text that changes dynamically on the client can be translated using the Localize(‚Ä¶) function inside the SetText(‚Ä¶) of SetTextIf(‚Ä¶) functions. Localize(text_code : string, interpolationParams? : JSON object) Parameters text_code the text code to translate. The text code must be registered in pbSimLangText with Type $AppUIResource. interpolationParams (optional) A JSON object with the interpolation information Suppose pbSimLangText has contains the following entries: ItemID LangID LangText Type ExpiryWarning EN Your subscription has expired $AppUIResource ExpiryWarning NO Abonnementet ditt har utl√∏pt $AppUIResource UserBirthMessage EN Hello, {{userName}}, your month of birth is {{monthOfBirth}} $AppUIResource UserBirthMessage NO Hei, {{userName}}, din f√∏dselsm√•ned er {{monthOfBirth}} $AppUIResource Example 1 Using the following expression, identities with EN as the selected locale will see the text \"Your subscription has expired!\" as the label text, while identities with NO as the selected locale text will see \"Abonnementet ditt har utl√∏pt!\". SetText(Localize(\"ExpiryWarning\")); Example 2 The example shows text translation: SetText(Localize(\"UserBirthMessage\", {\"userName\" : UserName, \"monthOfMonth\" : MonthOfBirth})); See Also More about Label in Forms Videos Workbooks Components - Label"

Building Subscreens You build and manage subscreens in the Workbook Designer. Like Pages, Subscreens consists of business logic (events and actions) and components such as Buttons, Filters, and Spreadsheets. Components are added to Subscreens by dragging and dropping items from the toolbox and organized in a grid layout (along rows and columns). Interaction Logic Subscreen components (such as buttons), can invoke actions on another component in the Subscreen, but cannot invoke actions on components outside the Subscreen. Raising events (outbound communication) To publish information from within a Subscreen to external components, you need to call the Raise Custom Event action of the Subscreen. You can pass along custom event data by calling the SetEventData(‚Ä¶) action instruction. If you do not call SetEventData(‚Ä¶), the event data from the calling context (for example a spreadsheet cell click) is passed along. Example This example shows how to use the SetEventData(‚Ä¶) instruction to set the event data when executing the Raise Custom Event action. // Create an event data object with a property called ‚ÄúMessage‚Äù, having the value ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù SetEventData({\"Message\" : \"Hello World\"}); In the event handler, you can get the message via **@Event.Data.Message** Custom Actions (inbound communication) You cannot directly invoke actions on components in Subscreens from outside the Subscreen itself. Instead, you need to create Custom Actions for the Subscreen and call these actions from the outside. Subscreen Custom Actions execute actions on components within the Subscreen, so they basically act as bridges between the outside and inside of Subscreens. To create Custom Actions for a Subscreen, open the Subscreen in edit mode (click to focus) and click Edit in the Properties pane. This will bring up the Custom Actions editor, where you can create, edit, and delete custom actions. The custom actions of Subscreens will be available in the Event handler editor of all other components added to pages. Using Subscreens Once a Subscreen has been created, it can be added to a Page or set as the content of a Tab Control Item. To add a Subscreen to a page, simply select the page in the Workbook Designer and drag-drop the Subscreen (from the Subscreen Toolbox) onto the page like any other component. To add a Subscreen to a Tab Control Item, simply select it from the Content dropdown of a Tab Item. Note Subscreen can only be used once pr Workbook.

As an example, a data flow for archiving the data set members can be added to an Action Activity as the last phase of a Workflow. Archive objects are created for every Data Store, Setting and View in the data set. The archiving process copies data from the working set to the archive by tagging each transaction with the id of the active workflow iteration. Data Set Properties Name Specifies the name of the Data Set. The Data Set Name is automatically assigned to the SYS_DataSetID column or new rows added to Settings displayed in Workbooks belonging to the Data Set (see the Workbooks property). The name of the Data Set can be read using the @Object[‚Ä¶].DataSet-directive. The name of the Data Set is not associated to Workflow Iterations, so the name does not change when a new iteration is started. To pass the Data Set Name to Data Flow Items which are set up to filter the data being processed by SYS_DataSetID columns in the participating data sources and Settings, you need to map the SYS_DataSetID Global Data Context variable to the SYS_DataSetID workbook variable in the Data Context Scope property of the Data Flow component in the Workbook designer. This setup requires that the Workbook is registered in the Workbooks property of the Data Set (refer to the property below). Workbooks Specifies which Workbooks belongs to the Data Set. The name of the Data Set will automatically be assigned to the SYS_DataSetID column of new rows added to Settings displayed in a Workbook. Filtering by Data Set when executing Data Flows When executing Data Flows containing Data Flow Items configured to filter data by the SYS_DataSetID column, for example the Financial Simulation Engines, the Data Set name needs to be passed as part of the arguments to the Data Flow. The standard way of doing this is to set up a Workflow and register the Workbook (which hosts the Data Flow) in the Workbooks collection of the Data Set. Next, ensure that the Global Data Context has been created in the Solution, and that it contains the SYS_DataSetID variable. Finally, edit the Data Context Scope property of the Data Flow component in the Workbook, and map the Global Data Context SYS_DataSetID variable to the Workbook SYS_DataSetID variable. Doing this will ensure that the Data Set name is assigned to the SYS_DataSetID variable when the Data Flow is executed, which in turn will enable any Data Flow Items to only use data belonging to the specified Data Set."

    "keywords": "Flow Control Objects are used for managing the state and controlling user access for performing actions (input, running scripts and data flows etc) on resources under Workflow control. You would normally have one Flow Control Object pr workflow sub process, where a sub process may be an entity called \"Salary\", containing the worksheets, settings, data flows etc handling input and business logic related to \"Salary\". By adding resources to Flow Control Objects, you specify that the resources will be controlled by the Workflow management system and the system will control identity access to the resources when deployed in Workbooks. The access rights grated to the identities are determined based on the states of the Flow Control Objects. After a Flow Control Object has been set up, it can be enabled for activities and connections. When enabling a Flow Control for an activity or connection, you need to specify the possible states the Flow Control Object may enter during the workflow phase. While the Workflow is running, the states can be set by identities working in Workbooks or by data flow processes. Typical states are \"Not started¬ª, \"Started\", \"Finished\", \"Rejected\", etc. State Context Object Flow Control Objects must have a context (for example department, region, project) that the various states can be set for. The context is specified by selecting the Dimension that a state should be set for. When publishing the Flow Control Object to a Workbook, the context must be associated to a filter in order to the state setting and getting to be handled correctly. Reporting Column(s) A comma separated list of columns in the State Context Object that the Workflow Status Report is generated from. Suppose the State Context Object is a Dimension with 3 levels (columns L1, L2 and LEAF). If you do not specify any Reporting Columns, the Status Report will contain the states for members from every level. If, for example, you only want the Status Report to contain the members at the leaf level, you enter name of the leaf level column. Relay State To Enables relaying state set for the Flow Control Object to other Flow Control Objects. Suppose a manager approves a report, \"Budget\", compiled from \"Salary\" and \"Management Accounts\" managed by different Flow Control Objects respectively. In this case, you would most likely want the state set for \"Budget\" to apply to the \"Budget\" contributers as well. Resources Resources that can be associated with Flow Control Objecs are Worksheets, Settings, Data Flows and Scripts. You create one Flow Control Object pr sub process, so as an example, a Flow Control Object for a payroll sub process should contain worksheets, settings, data flows and scripts having functionality related to payroll. When a resource is associated to a Flow Control Object, the actions the user can perform on the object is determined based on the state of the Flow Control Object for the selected context (e.g department or project) in the Workbook. If the state of the Flow Control Object is outside the boundaries of the permissions granted to the user, the user will not be able to perform any actions that can affect any of the resources of the Flow Control Object. For example, the user will not be able to edit or save data in a worksheet, or execute scripts or data flows. Note! A Worksheet can only be associated to a single Flow Control Object in the entire Solution."

    "keywords": "The contents of Data Stores are edited using Worksheets, which have an Excel-like look and feel. You would normally have just one Worksheet per Data Store, but you can have as many as you like. As long as any primary key columns of the Data Store is bound to the Worksheet, the other columns are optional. A Worksheet is always associated with just one Data Store, and once it has been created, you cannot change the binding. You can however, include data from other sources such as tables, views, stores, dimensions or fact tables to make calculations and save that value to the connected datastore. A Worksheet must be added to a Workbook to make it available to an end-user. Once a Worksheet had been added to a Workbook, identities can view, edit, and save data to the datastore through this worksheet. The contents of the Worksheet displayed to a user can be restricted by defining permissions for dimensions used for filtering, the static filter on the Worksheet component of a Workbook, or by specifying a dynamic filter when loading data in a Workbook context. Creating a Worksheet To create a Worksheet, right-click a Data Store in the Solution Explorer and select \"New Worksheet\". The newly created Worksheet will be bound to the Data Store, from which you can add columns and dimensions when designing the layout of the sheet. Adding columns Columns can be added to a Worksheet by drag and drop and droping from the toolbox, or pressing the ¬´Add Many¬ª button of the Columns list in the Worksheet designer. When creating a Worksheet, all key columns of the Data Store must be added to the Worksheet and the Worksheet must be configured in a way that ensures that all key columns are assigned values before data is saved to the database. If you do not want to show the key columns to the user, set the IsHidden property of each column to \"True\". In many cases, you would want to hide ID-columns and rather show a descriptive text or value instead. For example, suppose you have a Worksheet containing employees, you‚Äôd rather see the employee name (maybe combined with an id) than just the employee id in your Worksheet. To do this, you need Dimensions bound to your Data Store. The dimensions contain the member ids and properties, such as names, descriptions, etc. To display one of these properties in the Worksheet in addition to the id of the entity, drag the property (column) you want to display from a dimension in the Dimensions-section of the Worksheet designer Toolbox. Referring to our employee-example, you would add and bind the Employee dimension to your Data Store and add the Employee_Name column from the Dimension to the Worksheet. When a dimension property column is used in a Worksheet, the Id-column can be edited by enabling the property column as a Dropdown editor column. When editing using a DrodDown column, the Id-column should be read-only, since editing the Id-column will not update the value in the Dropdown/property column.

This is useful if you have some constant or other value that is set outside the spreadsheet that you want to use in your formulas. You can read the value of a Workbook variable by calling AppVariables.getValue(\"variable name\") or reading the value directly as a property from the AppVariables object : AppVariables.TheVariable. Example Suppose you have assigned a value to the variable Factor in your workbook, you can get the value of Factor in your formula like this: @Amount[] = @TotalForce[] * AppVariables.getValue(\"Factor\"); or @Amount[] = @TotalForce[] * AppVariables.Factor AppVariables.getValue(\"X\") vs AppVariables.X You need use the getValue(‚Ä¶) function rather than accessing the property if your variable name contains white spaces. For example, if your variable is called @Var[My Variable], using AppVariables.@Var[My Variable] will not work because a property name cannot contain whitespace and [] characthers. Instead, you would need to use AppVariables.getValue(\"@Var[My Variable]\"); Executing formulas after an AppVariable has been changed If you modify an AppVariable outside of a Worksheet or Setting, (for example from a Form Element), and that AppVariable is used in a formula, you need to invoke the RecalcAction of the Worksheet of Setting. For example, if you're entering some value into a Form element, and you want to trigger a recalc based on the new value, you need to execute the RecalcAction from the SelectionChanged event of the Form Element."

You would want to use this option over standard formulas when one or more of the following applies: In order to do the calculations, you need data that is not available in the data set of the spreadsheet, or in the data set of other spreadsheets loaded in the Workbook. You need to do fairly complex calculations with a lot of conditionals (if-else). You need to use math functions or custom logic that is not supported by the standard Eaze library. You want the calculation service to maintain state between executions (the calculation service executes whenever a cell value change). You want one instance of the calculation service pr spreadsheet. Setting up a Calculation Instance Factory To set up a Calculation Instance Factory, click \"Insert Configuration Template\". This will create an Xml configuration like the one below: <ComputeInstanceFactory> <Instance Name=\"my.calculator\" FactoryFunction=\"myLib.createCalculator\"> <FactoryFunctionArguments> <SqlScript Id=\"sql script object id | @Object[sql script name].Id\"/> ... </FactoryFunctionArguments> </Instance> </ComputeInstanceFactory> <Instance Name=\"calculation service instance name\"/> specifies the name of the variable that the calculation service created by the FactoryFunction is assigned to. Use this name to call a function in your calculation service. For example, with <Instance Name=\"my.calculator\"/>, if the created calculation service has a function 'add', you can call the add function from a formula like this: this.my.calculator.add(‚Ä¶) <Instance FactoryFunction=\"factory function name\"/> specifies the name of the function called by InVision to create an instance of the calculation service. The factory function must be available on the (browser) window object, and it must return a new instance of a the calculation service. The factory function can take 0 or many arguments, which can be defined in the FactoryFunctionArguments section. <SqlScript id=\"id|@Object[<name>].Id\"/> specifies a Sql Script in the Solution that returns some data. The Sql Scripts in the FactoryFunctionArguments section is passed as arguments to the FactoryFunction in the order they are defined. At the moment, only SQL Scripts that returns data are supported. You can specify the Id of the SQL Script either using the actual object id, or using the @Object[<name>].Id syntax. What is a Calculation Service A calculation service is simply a JavaScript object that has the necessary business logic to perform some operation on data related to a spreadsheet. What is the Factory Function A factory function is a function that creates an instance of a calculation service and returns it to the spreadsheet calculation engine. Creating a Calculation Service and Factory Function You have two options for creating a calculation service and factory function: Use a JavaScript Solution Object when you need small and / or simple calculation service. Develop, test and build using your preferred toolbox, for example TypeScript, Visual Studio Code, NodeJS, Jasmine, etc and then deploy to the /Scripts/plugins folder so that it's loaded to Workbooks. If you have dependencies on 3rd party libraries, such as requirejs, d3js etc, you need to edit the plugins.json file in the /Scripts/plugins folder and list all files in the order that they should be loaded in the browser. The contents of the file must have the following format: { \"files\" : [\"3rdparty-lib1.js\", \"3rdparty-lib2\", \"mycalc-lib.js\"] } Primary Operators Operator . (x.y) Member access. Example \"xyx\".substring(‚Ä¶) Operator X?.y Null conditional member access. Returns null if the left hand operand is null.

The operands in an expression can be hard coded values, such as strings and numbers, column references and functions.

Enforce uniqueness Enable this property to prevent the user from selecting the same value from the Dropdown editor for two different rows. Distinct Values Specifies that the Dropdown editor should only contain distinct values from the Dropdown data source. Disable Access Control Only applies to Dropdowns for linked dimension columns. Specifies that any Access Control rules defined for the dimension should be ignored when loading data to the Dropdown editor. Setting up Dropdown for a linked dimension column Note! (Only applies to Worksheets) When setting up Dropdown editing for a linked dimension column, you first need to ensure that the Data Store column that the dimension is bound to in the star schema configuration is added to the Worksheet. Note! If there is no fact data source attached to the Data Store column, you need to ensure that the dimension binding type is set to \"Relationship\". Because the star schema binding configuration specifies the relationship between the dimension column and the Data Store column, the Data Store column added to the Worksheet will get its values updated when the user selects a value from the Dropdown editor containing dimension property values. To enable Dropdown editing of the column, check \"Enable Dropdown Selection\" in the property editor. Setting up Dropdown for a standard column When setting up Dropdown editing of a standard column, you need to specify where the dropdown editor should get its values from, and optionally which other columns in the grid to update based on the selected value. Specify Data Source using @Object directive Allows specifying the Data Source for the dropdown editor using the @Object-directive. We use this property when setting up a Dropdown for resources that should be deployed as part of a template. Using the @Object-directive allows you to specify the Solution object name of the Dropdown data source instead of the materialized table name, which is unique for each object instance. Source Table Specifies the data source for the Dropdown editor. The data source can be a Data Store, Setting, Fact, Dimension or View. Source Value Member Column The column in the data source that should be used as the display member of the dropdown list. Target Column The column in the data set of the grid to have its value updated from Source Column. Secondary Update Using the Secondary Update option, you can set up the Dropdown editor to set the value of a second column in the grid when a value is selected. Source Display Member Column The column in the data source that contains the values to use for updating the second column in the grid. Target Column The second column of the grid to update when a value is selected in the Dropdown editor. Custom Display Column Expression A Sql expression that returns the value to display in the Dropdown column. Note When you apply a Custom Display Column Expression to a Dropdown column editor, you need to use Custom Query and apply the same expression to the corresponding column in the custom query. Example Suppose you have a Worksheet with a linked dimension column and want to enable Dropdown editing of the column, but you want to display a computed value in the dropdown editor. The column name is ‚Äòaccount167AccountID_Name‚Äô. 1) In the Dropdown editor configuration, specify the following expression SUBSTRING(@Context.ObjectAlias.AccountID_Name,0,2) AS account167AccountID_Name 2) From the Query tab in the Worksheet designer, enable \"Use custom query to load data\" and edit, Sync with Designer to get the standard query expression and edit the column expression for the joined dimension column. SELECT store.PBRowIdentity, ISNULL(store.IsLocked,0) AS IsLocked, SUBSTRING(T0.[AccountID_Name],0,2) AS [account167AccountID_Name] ,store.[AccountID] AS [AccountID] FROM [Store_Hypotesia_05182015125711] store INNER JOIN [dbo].[DimLink_AccountWOarPFrSvNwgMF9XY3OC_account167] T0 ON store.[AccountID] = T0.[AccountID] COLLATE DATABASE_DEFAULT Filter A Sql expression used in a WHERE clause to filter the values of the Dropdown editor. Example SUBSTRING(@Context.ObjectAlias.AccountID_Name,0,2) = '12' You can use custom parameters as part of the filter expression, which enables the dropdown list to contain only a subset of the default items. To use this option, you need to use the SetParamValue(‚Ä¶) and ReloadDropDownItems(‚Ä¶) directives in the LoadData action of the Workbook component. Example This example shows how to use a custom parameter to filter the available items in the dropdown editor. To pass a value to the @ItemID parameter, you must use the SetParamValue(‚Ä¶) and the @ReloadDropDownItems(‚Ä¶) instructions in the LoadData action of the Workbook component. The LoadData action instruction list must contain the following: SetParamValue(\"@ItemID\",@Var[ItemID]); ReloadDropDownItems(); The filter expression: @Context.ObjectAlias.ItemID = @ItemID Order By A SQL expression used for ordering the values of the Dropdown editor. Example LEFT(@Context.ObjectAlias.AccountID_Name,2) See Also Dropdown - Form Elements Dropdown - Control Videos Dropdown Selection Dropdown"

As long as Use Custom Query to load data is enabled, the query defined in the custom query editor will be used for loading data to the worksheet. If you decide to revert to using the standard way or loading data, you can safely disable the option without loosing the custom query. If you decide to use a custom query to load data, you need to ensure that the columns in the data set returned from the custom query matches the columns defined in the Worksheet Layout by name, data type and count. When you‚Äôre in the custom query designer, you can press View Standard Query to view the query generated based on the Worksheet Layout.

    "title": "On Save | Profitbase Docs",
    "keywords": "InVision provides a way to hook into the process of saving Worksheet and Setting data from the end user client. The hook lets you execute custom business logic such as data validation, modifying data, sending messages and so on. The custom business logic can be written in C# and T-SQL, and is executed automatically if the feature is enabled. Saving data is performed as a sequence of steps where rows scheduled for deletion is handled first, then updates, and finally new rows are added. You can write custom business logic that can execute before and after each one of these steps. The diagram below shows the pipeline being executed during a save process. OnBeginSave(CudPackage data) This function executes once before any data is saved. The argument passed to the function is and object of type CudPackage (Cud = create, update, delete) containing the rows to delete, update and insert. OnBeforeSave (IEnumerable<CudRecord> rows, TableOperationType operationType) This function executes once for each batch or rows (deletes, updates and inserts) before any data is saved. The first argument passed to the function is the collection of rows to delete, update or insert. The second argument passed to the function is the type of operation; Delete, Update or Insert. OnAfterSave (IEnumerable<CudRecord> rows, TableOperationType operationType) This function executes once for each batch or rows (deletes, updates, inserts) after the data has been saved to the database. The first argument passed to the function is the collection of rows that was deleted, updated or inserted. The second argument passed to the function is the type of operation; Delete, Update or Insert. OnEndSave(CudPackage data) This function executes one time when the all the changes have been saved to the database. The argument passed to the function is and object of type CudPackage (Cud = create, update, delete) containing the rows that was deleted, updated and inserted. Executing SQL Scripts from the main pipeline SQL Scripts can be executed from the pipeline by calling Sql Execute functions, passing the name of the name of the Sql scriptet to execute. Any aruments to the script can be passed as the second parameter to the function. Example ‚Äì Executing a named SQL Script,\"Script1\", without parameters. protected override void OnBeginSave(CudDataPackage data) { ‚Ä¶ ExecuteNonQuery(Script1); } Example ‚Äì Executing a SQL query without parameters protected override void OnBeginSave(CudDataPackage data) { ‚Ä¶ var vehicleId = \"x\"; ExecuteNonQuery(string.Concat(\"INSERT INTO Table1 (VehicleID,Distance) VALUES('\", vehicleId, \"', 300)\")); } Named SQL Scripts If you want to execute sql scripts in the save pipeline, it is recommended to create Named Sql Scripts to keep the code in the main pipeline cleaner. When creating a Named Sql Script, you simply create a SQL script and assign a name to it. When you want to execute that script in the save pipeline, you simply provide the name of the script to the execute function instead of inlining the sql statement in the function. Named Sql Scripts are created using standard T-Sql syntax and optionally InVision direktives. Executing business logic before save You can execute custom business logic before data is saved by overriding the OnBeginSave and OnBeforeSave methods. OnBeforeSave executes once pr batch type (Insert, Update and Delete), while OnBeginSave executes only once for the entire save process. If you override OnBeforeSave, you need to check the value of the operationType parameter to determine if the rows are inserted, updated or deleted. Example This example shows how to can override the OnBeginSave method to execute a SQL query for each new row being inserted during a save process. The example also shows how to create a parameterized SQL query and pass arguments using a list of QueryParam objects. protected override void OnBeginSave(CudDataPackage data) { if(data.Inserts != null) { foreach(var row in data.Inserts) { ExecuteNonQuery(\"Update @Object[UpdateHistory].DbObjectName SET IsManuallyModified = 1 WHERE ItemID = @ItemID AND RegionID = @RegionID\", new QueryParam[]{ new QueryParam(\"@ItemID\", row.GetValue<string>(\"ItemID\")), new QueryParam(\"@RegionID\",row.GetValue<string>(\"RegionID\"))}, true); } } } Excecuting business logic after save You can execute custom business logic after data has been saved by overriding the OnAfterSave or OnEndSave methods. OnAfterSave executes once pr batch type (Insert, Update and Delete), while OnEndSave executes only once for the entire save process. If you override OnAfterSave, you need to check the value of the operationType parameter to determine if the rows were inserted, updated or deleted. Example This example shows how to override the OnEndSave to execute a SQL query for each row that was updated during the save process. The example also shows how to create a parameterized SQL query and pass arguments using a list of QueryParam objects. protected override void OnEndSave(CudDataPackage data) { if(data.Updates != null) { foreach(var row in data.Updates) { ExecuteNonQuery(\"Update @Object[UpdateHistory].DbObjectName SET IsManuallyModified = 1 WHERE AccountID = @AccountID\", new QueryParam[]{ new QueryParam(\"@AccountID\" row.GetValue<string>(\"AccountID\")) }, true); } } } QueryParam Used for passing arguments to parameterized SQL queries or Named SQL Scripts. Constructors: Method QueryParam(string paramName, object value) Creates a new instance of this object. Properties: ParamName System.String The name of the parameter specified in the SQL expression. ParamValue System.Object The value of the parameter. TableOperationType Enum describing the type of operation being executed. Values: Insert Rows are being inserted. Update Rows are being updated. Delete Rows are being deleted. Example This example shows to override OnAfterSave and examine the operationType parameter to determine if the rows being passed to the method will be inserted, updated or deleted. protected override void OnAfterSave(IEnumerable<CudRecord> rows, TableOperationType operationType) { base.OnAfterSave(rows, operationType); if(operationType == TableOperationType.Update) { // Implementation goes here } } Sql Execute functions ExecuteNonQuery Executes a SQL expression and returns the number of rows affected.

Example Suppose you create a CSS class named \"ImportantRowStyle\" and want to apply the style to all rows where ProductID equals ‚ÄòXYZ‚Äô. To apply the style to the rows, use the following syntax: SETROWSTYLE(ProductID == \"XYZ\", \"ImportantRowStyle\"); Example Suppose you have created a custom row, and want to apply a style, \"CustomRowStyle\", to the row. When you created the custom row, you had to specify the value for ObjectId property (for example -1). To apply a style to the custom row, use the ObjectId to address the custom row using the following syntax: SETROWSTYLE(ObjectId == -1, \"CustomRowStyle\"); Styling the Summary Row The summary row is a special row that is pinned to the bottom of the spreadsheet by InVision. In order to style this row, you can use SetRowStyle(‚Ä¶) just like with any other row in combination with the IsSummaryRow(row) and GetCallContextRow() functions for determining whether a row is the summary row. Example SetRowStyle(IsSummaryRow(GetCallContextRow()), \"css class\");"

Stacked Column Headers are configured from the Stacked Columns editor in the Worksheet or Report Table Designer. In addition to the grouping headers, the Stacked Column Headers configuration must contain all the baseline columns of the Worksheet or Report at the lowest level of the stack. If you modify the Worksheet or Report by removing, adding or renaming baseline columns, you must update the Stacked Column Headers configuration accordingly. To create a Stacked Column Headers configuration, start by creating a \"New Configuration\". This will add all the baseline columns from the Worksheet or Report to the configuration. To create a grouping column, press \"Add Stack Root\" and set values for the properties. You need to ensure that all Key properties within the stacking configuration is unique. To group the columns, move the baseline columns by dragging and dropping them to grouping columns. You can create multiple levels of grouping columns, but the baseline columns must always be at the lowest level of a branch."

Hide Grid Lines Specifies whether to show cell borders in the grid or not. Is Row Selector Visible Specifies whether the header / selector is visible or not. Is Row Locking Enabled Specifies whether the user can toggle row locking on and off from the context menu. Is Summary Row Enabled Specifies whether the summary row for the grid is enabled for end users. Allow Sorting Specifies whether to allow users to sort the contents of the grid by clicking the column headers. Inline Filtering Specifies which (if any) custom filtering options to provide to end users in the grid. Allowed Input Level Use this option to specify the level at which the selected filter values must exist in order to enable editing of the Worksheet. Context Menu Options Select All Selects all rows and columns in the grid. Export to Excel Exports the entire contents of the grid to Excel. Copy Copies the selected cells to the application clipboard. To copy to the OS clipboard, use Ctrl+C. Paste Pastes the contents of the application clipboard into the grid. To paste from the OS clipboard, use Ctrl+V. Insert row Inserts a row above the right clicked row. Insert row below Inserts a row below the right clicked row. Distribute value Distributes a value to the selected cells, using the specified distribution method. Factor multiplication Multiplies the selected cells by a factor. Reverse distribute evenly Distributes the value of a cell evenly to the factors of its sum formula. For example, given the following formula @Total[] = @P01[] + @P02[], if you edit a cell in the Total column and do a reverse distribution, it will distribute the value evenly to P01 and P02. Reverse distribute relatively Distributes the value of a cell relatively to the factors of its sum formula. Edit or view comments Opens the comments dialog for the cell. This option is only available if comments are enabled for the underlying storage column. View changes Opens the dialog that displays the changes made to a cell.

    "title": "Context Menu Options Conditions | Profitbase Docs",
    "keywords": "To specify whether a context menu option should be available, you have the following options: Yes This means that the context menu option will always be available to all users. Some options may be disabled if it cannot be executed. For example, the Paste option will be disabled if there‚Äôs nothing on the clipboard. No This means that the context menu option will not appear at all. Conditional Use this option if an option needs to be conditionally available, for example, based on some Workbook variable or value in the cell or row that is clicked. How to write a condition A condition is a function with a parameter called args. The args parameter contains information about The row(s) that is currently selected, including the row that was right clicked. The column that was right clicked. Any Workbook variables you have defined in addition to the variables provided by the system. The function must return true or false. If true is returned, the menu option is enabled. If false is returned, the menu item is disabled. args.selectedRows is an array containing one or more objects. An object has property names matching the columns in the source query, for example ‚ÄúAccountID‚Äù, ‚ÄúDepartmentID‚Äù, ‚ÄúAmount‚Äù, etc. Example The following example will enable a menu option if the AccountID starts with 3 and Amount is greater than 100 000. const {selectedRows, column, variables} = args const row = selectedRows[0] return row.AccountID?.startsWith(\"3\") && row.Amount > 100000 Example // Descructure the args parameter to it's easier to work with // - selectedRows contains all the currently selected rows in the spreadsheet, including the row that was right clicked // - column holds information about the column that was right clicked (use column.name) // - variables contain all the Workbook variables provided by the system as well as those defined by you const {selectedRows, column, variables} = args; // Inspect args in the Browser DevTools console console.log({args}); // Get the value of a Workbook variable const myWorkbookVariable = variables.MyWorkbookVariable; // Get information such as user name of the logged in user, workbook id, and solution id const userName = variables.SYS.CurrentUserName; const workbookId = variables.SYS.WorkbookId; const solutionId = variables.SYS.SolutionId; // Get the query string parameter \"employeeId\" const employeeId = variables.QSP.employeeId; // The condition must return true or false return selectedRows[0].AccountID !== \"1234\" && selectedRows[0].Value > 200;"

Users can leverage the platform's comprehensive standard components to develop a wide range of elements, including user interfaces and back-end functionality. This streamlined approach significantly reduces both cost and time when implementing projects. Users utilize the Profitbase InVision Designer to construct applications, which are subsequently published as web applications within the organization. These web applications require minimal or no training to operate effectively. Within a matter of minutes, users can download prebuilt business modules and install them, tailoring them to precisely meet the specific requirements of the customer. Profitbase InVision seamlessly integrates with other business systems through a RESTful Web API or direct connection to the SQL data storage, facilitating effortless connectivity. Users can expand Profitbase InVision's capabilities by constructing custom business modules using the Profitbase InVision Designer developer tool and Microsoft Visual Studio. Solution A solution contains all of the data and configuration for your application, such as business logic, data stores, workbooks, worksheets, data flows, workflows, etc. Clone Solution You can easily clone entire Solutions from the Designer start page. Cloning a Solution will also copy input data from the source Solution, permissions, and Data Flow schedules. Note that objects in cloned Solutions are not automatically added to the Data Pool after the cloning has been completed. They will, however, be added to the Data Pool if the Data Pool Compound View is rebuilt. If you don‚Äôt want this to happen, you need to edit your newly cloned Solution and remove the Data Pool configuration from the objects that you don‚Äôt want as members of the Data Pool. When creating a new Solution Creating a new Solution requires specifying whether the Solution should provide contents to Work Process blueprints or not. This change was added because it was too easy to forget to set this property after a Package had been deployed. Designer The designer is the development tool for the InVision platform needed to create or modify solutions created on the InVision platform. The designer is a desktop application that is downloaded locally to your PC or server. Workbooks Workbooks are the user interfaces for the applications created on the InVision platform."
